I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after \\\"RRR.\\\"This movie is so much. Its \\\"much\\\"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \\\"RRR.\\\"Grade: A+\",\n          \"It's brutal, ridiculous, action-packed, fun, entertaining, yet... again, brutal... Masculine. It has all these qualities modern American movies can't possibly have anymore, so no wonder this Indian movie is doing so well in the west.People needed it.And I needed this. My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India. Show those weaklings how it's done. Remind them how fun and awesome movies can be.\",\n          \"We watched the Oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from RRR. It was overwhelming and spectacular! So, we searched out RRR here at home and watched the entire movie last night. WHAT A THRILLING EXPERIENCE! I had never seen anything quite like this. The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen. We highly recommend this fabulous, exciting movie.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 5,\n        \"max\": 10,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          9,\n          6,\n          8\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after \\\"RRR.\\\"This movie is so much. Its \\\"much\\\"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \\\"RRR.\\\"Grade: A+\",\n          \"It's brutal, ridiculous, action-packed, fun, entertaining, yet... again, brutal... Masculine.

My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India.

The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen.

Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one.

It has all these qualities modern American movies can't possibly have anymore, so no wonder this Indian movie is doing so well in the west.People needed it.And I needed this. My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India.

It was overwhelming and spectacular! So, we searched out RRR here at home and watched the entire movie last night. WHAT A THRILLING EXPERIENCE! I had never seen anything quite like this. The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen.

I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after \\\"RRR.\\\"This movie is so much. Its \\\"much\\\"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \\\"RRR.\\\"Grade: A+\",\n          \"It's brutal, ridiculous, action-packed, fun, entertaining, yet... again, brutal... Masculine. It has all these qualities modern American movies can't possibly have anymore, so no wonder this Indian movie is doing so well in the west.People needed it.And I needed this. My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India. Show those weaklings how it's done. Remind them how fun and awesome movies can be.\",\n          \"We watched the Oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from RRR. It was overwhelming and spectacular! So, we searched out RRR here at home and watched the entire movie last night. WHAT A THRILLING EXPERIENCE! I had never seen anything quite like this. The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen. We highly recommend this fabulous, exciting movie.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rating\",\n

My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \\\"RRR.\\\"Grade: A+\",\n          \"It's brutal, ridiculous, action-packed, fun, entertaining, yet... again, brutal... Masculine. It has all these qualities modern American movies can't possibly have anymore, so no wonder this Indian movie is doing so well in the west.People needed it.And I needed this. My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India.

It was overwhelming and spectacular! So, we searched out RRR here at home and watched the entire movie last night. WHAT A THRILLING EXPERIENCE! I had never seen anything quite like this. The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen.

The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.?

I've seen everything from the most mainstream movie imaginable to the most experimental. I can't even remember the last time I came away from a movie thinking that I'd never seen anything like it. But that's how I felt after \\\"RRR.\\\"This movie is so much. Its \\\"much\\\"-ness may be a turn off to some, and almost was for me. My wife and I nearly bailed at the 20 minute mark because the film is so over the top and ridiculous. But we got hooked, and then I was totally in for the ride, to the point where I was disappointed that this 3+-hour behemoth was ending.Do you like to see muscle-bound, slicked-up men fighting tigers? Check. How about public floggings that turn into musical numbers? Got it. Evil British people so extremely evil that England should sue the filmmakers for defamation? Sure. How about evil British people being mauled by rampaging jungle animals? You betcha. Beheadings? Yep. Romance? Of course. Homoeroticism so intense just watching this movie may turn you gay? Hoo-boy. Let's just say that anything not already in this movie isn't worth having anyway.Watch \\\"RRR,\\\" and then make sure whatever the first movie is that you watch after it is one you don't care too much about, because it will most certainly feel like the palest imitation of a movie you have ever seen. Seriously, this movie is so deliriously bonkers and so unafraid to be absolutely absurd that it's almost impossible to watch pretty much any other movie now and not be disappointed by it for not being this one. Thanks a lot \\\"RRR.\\\"Grade: A+\",\n          \"It's brutal, ridiculous, action-packed, fun, entertaining, yet... again, brutal... Masculine. It has all these qualities modern American movies can't possibly have anymore, so no wonder this Indian movie is doing so well in the west.People needed it.And I needed this. My only real issue is that it's 3 hours long. But man, it's 3 hours packed with insane action, superb music, lots of tension, and lots of raw testosterone. It's absolutely crazy how long it's been since I've seen a movie like this.And it's not just all that - it's generally flawlessly executed. It's perfect at what it's trying to be. Great job, India. Show those weaklings how it's done. Remind them how fun and awesome movies can be.\",\n          \"We watched the Oscar show last week and witnessed the performance of the song from RRR. It was overwhelming and spectacular! So, we searched out RRR here at home and watched the entire movie last night. WHAT A THRILLING EXPERIENCE! I had never seen anything quite like this. The movie has everything - spectacle, action, music, dancing and singing, drama - and the list goes on! The three plus hours of its running time flew by and we finished it wanting more. Hollywood could learn alot about exciting film making from the Indian Film Industry. Now a few questions... Why was this film not nominated for quite a number of Oscars? It should have been the Indian entry in the International Film category. What about other Oscar nominations - for cinematograpy, costuming, music score, film editing etc.? We have decided to search out more Indian films available to us. It must have been a wonderful experience to see RRR in a theatre on a large screen.

        "  Natural language processing (NLP) uses two basic techniques to examine the links and structure of sentences: constituency parsing and dependency parsing. Constituency parsing is the process of dissecting a sentence into its component phrases, which are then shown in a hierarchical tree structure. The syntactic structure of the sentence in the given text sample is revealed by the constituency parsing tree, which shows how words are arranged into phrases and clauses. To produce words like \"seen a lot,\" \"made a lot,\" and \"time around the world,\" for example, the verbs \"made\" and \"seen\" are combined with the nouns \"lot,\" \"movie,\" and \"time.\" These nouns and verbs are further modified with adjectives and adverbs like \"different,\" \"mainstream,\" and \"even,\" which enhance the text's descriptive subtleties.\n",

        "The assignment presented a comprehensive task involving various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which I found both challenging and enjoyable. Implementing functionalities like POS tagging, constituency parsing, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition required a good understanding of NLP concepts and tools like NLTK and Stanford CoreNLP. Managing the flow of data from web scraping to text cleaning and then to syntactic analysis demanded careful planning and attention to detail. The diversity of tasks within the assignment made it intellectually stimulating, and I appreciated the opportunity to apply and deepen my knowledge of NLP. However, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of each step, especially in handling large volumes of text data, added complexity to the assignment. Overall, I found the time allotted for the assignment adequate, although certain aspects, like debugging and refining the code, could have benefited from more time.\n",
