            "Review 1: 'The Godfather' is the pinnacle of flawless films! The first time I viewed 'The Godfather' I was in my early teens and it was the most astounding film I had ever seen, and has since then stood as my all-time favourite film. It is due to this that I have been looking forward to writing a review of this unforgettable classic. So let's start from the beginning. The film opens to four words, 'I believe in America', it's crazy to think that this simple line has become a resonant quote solely due to the impact it made on the entrance to the film's \"threshold\". This is just one of the many renowned quotes that litter the film, and believe me, there are a lot. After the first take we are then absorbed into the life of Vito Corleone, brilliantly portrayed by the Oscar- winning performance of Marlon Brando. Vito is a feared man, he is a criminal, he is a mafioso, but above all he is a respected family man, his three sons are depicted by three excellent actors, James Caan, John Cazale and Al Pacino as well as his adopted child Tom Hagen, played by Robert Duvall. The film follows Vito as he attempts to transfer his crime empire to his reluctant son, Michael. With some of the most graphic and gruesome death scenes to have ever been seen in the 1970's film industry (including a certain horse's head), 'The Godfather' epitomises how violence can be used effectively within a film. The Corleone's are some of the greatest antiheroes to have ever been seen on screen, whilst they are villains, the audience will refuse to accept that fact, Coppola does something simple and audacious, he takes the guilt out of organised crime. A film rife with beautiful cinematography, memorable musical scores and well-paced action and drama. Overall, The Godfather is one of Hollywood's greatest critical and commercial successes that gets everything right; a gangster flick that is overflowing with life, rich with emotion and subtle acting, and further blessed with amazing direction from Francis Ford Coppola. Arguably the most unforgettable masterpiece to have ever been made.\n",

            "Review 2: It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.\n",

            "Review 3: A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 4: This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n",

            "Review 5: One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 6: Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse's head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I'll give him an offer he can't refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don't know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 7: The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather's influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public's imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don's power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone's ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito's younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra's real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won't go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.\n",

            "Review 8: There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox\n",

            "Review 9: Up until today, I haven't bothered to review \"The Godfather\". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.\n",

            "Review 10: This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.\n",

            "Review 11: THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.\n",

            "Review 12: Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.\n",

            "Review 13: \"The Godfather\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I've ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I've ever seen or will ever see. It's also one of the most precise and intricate films I've ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \"The Godfather,\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is what brings this film, that's so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He's the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny's (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" We get the feeling that Michael's nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He's the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family's actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He's treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader's confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can't refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino' shinning moment in the film. There's no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get's upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo's height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \"Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\"That's some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael's change believable. He's not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he's capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \"It's strictly business\" when it comes to family issues. Michael's sister, Connie, calls him a \"cold hearted bastard\" at the end of the film. It's hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino' performance is that he doesn't sugarcoat it. He doesn't try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That's the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let's us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \"The Godfather,\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.\n",

            "Review 14: This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.\n",

            "Review 15: You can't really criticize a film like \"The Godfather\", especially from a younger-type guy like me. Since its release in 1972, \"The Godfather\" has been highly praised by fans universally. It's extremely hard for a person who has never seen \"The Godfather\" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster's depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter's wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It's not revenge, as long as your daughter's still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a \"Moustache\" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it's just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it's up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo's book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. \"The Godfather\" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino's Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael's transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it's handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It's also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that's good for the novel's sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words \"required viewings.\"\n",

            "Review 16: This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on alot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.This is definetely a \"must see\" masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 17: It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.\n",

            "Review 18: Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10\n",

            "Review 19: I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.\n",

            "Review 20: My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation. All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an \"offer he can't refuse\", or \"Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes\" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played.\n",

What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.\n",

Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did.

He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business. Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's. Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather. So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos. An all-time classic.\n",

            "Review 27: Michael Corleone returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. However his return coincides with the beginnings of a war between the main families sparked by the marketing of drugs.  Michael's involvement in the family business increases when his father is the victim of an assassination attempt and Michael wants to kill the two men responsible before going to Italy for a year to lay low.  When Michael's brother Sonny is murdered, Michael returns home to take control of the family and clear up the war.The most famous and the best film about organised crime is also one of the best films ever made.  The plot is at once straightforward and complex, it deals with things on many levels from the action to the theme of family. The basic story is gripping and sprawling at the same time.  It creates many memorable scenes and lines that have become part of the general knowledge that we all share  that's why it's referred to in everything from Sopranos down to The Simpsons.Every shot is perfectly framed and has a great sense of period throughout. From the opening speech with it's memorable lines and camera focus down to the final shot and all it implies, it is full throughout.  The action is a pleasure to watch and the lines are so much more classy than more recent attempts at gangster films.Pacino is great  he not only changes before our eyes over the 3 hours but he manages it into the next film too.  Brando is always a risk on any film, and when he started mumbling and filling his cheeks with cotton wool, Coppola must have worried about what was happening, but he delivers a performance that is so good that almost everyone has impersonated him at some time.  The main cast is full of good performances from actors from all stages.  Up and comers such as Duvall, Caan, Keaton etc are as good as more ageing icons such as Richard Conte, Sterling Haydn, Castellano etc.In every area the film oozes class and professionalism.  The look at family life is excellent and the only downside is that it can't help but glamorise organised crime  people may be killed but it still looks and sounds cool. But then, if we're going to start criticising films because they glamorise violence or destruction then The Godfather comes along way down the hit list  long after countless hundreds of action movies and summer blockbusters.Overall this film will always be a classic, your Harry Potters, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings etc will come and go based on how well hyped they are  but Godfather has been on most people's top 5 list for decades and will to continue to be for many more.  Now that's respect.\n",

            "Review 28: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes.\n",

            "Review 29: Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the \"greatest films of all time\". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, \"Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?\" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to \"11\" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of \"oscillating\" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) \"zoom out\" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the \"greatest film of all time\" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a \"historical family saga\" as a crime or gangster film.\n",

            "Review 30: \"The Godfather\" is a huge piece of film entertaining, involving sentiment, nostalgia, filial affection, pride, integrity, loyalty, corruption, honor, betrayal and crime... Within weeks of its release, it was clearly a blockbuster, a cinematic phenomenon, an exquisite Mafia epic with outstanding performances... Coppola got everything right, creating a landmark in American cinema...His film acutely details the inner workings of the criminal \"families,\" and the ruthlessness of those in organized crime, but also examines their steadfast loyalty, love for blood relations, and code of ethics... Coppola and Puzo subtly weave a complex narrative with themes of hypocrisy, power, and corruption which stands as a pulsating reflection of our uncertain times... With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando creates a personage that will be remembered for ever... The line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" has reached legendary statues... Brando's Don Corleone is the moral center of the film: a tough, wise, feared old Sicilian who has risen to become an all powerful leader in an empire of Italian-American organized crime...While crime may be the first image that comes into one's mind in the film, violence plays a vital part in this complicated tale... Brando is the head of one of the five families who are said to control the Mafia in the area of New York... He is opposed to any involvement in drugs, and refuses to risk his political contacts and prestige for such putrefied money... He is behind the time but he understands that society is not alarmed by \"liquor, gambling, and even women...\" He is also a loving family man... His sons, relatives and friends are part of his operations... He despises displays of weakness... He understands the strength of power and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"sovereignty.\" In the outdoor garden, father and son are affectionate to each other, but cannot express their emotions openly...The Corleones are a warm, close family and the motion picture (with l0 Oscar Nominations) shows the flavor of Italian-American home life... Don Corleone is an undisputed patriarch, and as played by Brando, he has almost the manner of a religious leader... His voice is quite and rasping, his chin stands as a symbol of his authority, and men kisses his hand as they ask for his favors... He is a charismatic leader and his eyes reflect his kind heart as his implacability...Pacino's gradual and subtle transformation is the heart of the film... From a gentle man to one of the most cunning, ruthless, and cold-blooded man ever to come on the screen, he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders and always keep his own counsel... His commandment \"Never to take sides against the Family.\" The opening shot of \"The Godfather\" sets the tone of the film as Don Corleone and some of his family listen to an undertaker, Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Cirsitto), pleading for justice for the near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter...Attending the wedding of his sister Connie to young bookmaker Carlo Rizzi, Michael, a highly decorated Marine captain from World War II, points out the other guests to Kate (Diane Keaton), his non-Italian girlfriend... In the same time Coppola introduces us to his large cast of characters:Sonny (James Caan), the rough, hot-headed impulsive kid who never really grew up; Fredo (John Cazale), the troubled, shy, weak young man who can't seem to do anything right; Tom (Robert Duvall), the right-hand man, the legal adviser and adopted son to the Godfather steady, reliable, always thinking, always controlled; Connie (Talia Shire), the battered wife and rebellious sister, who achieves and promotes the movie's most horrific scene; Johnny Fontane (Al Martine), the idol star whose tears set up the shocking moment when a movie \"big shot\" named Jack Woltz (John Marley) finds himself in an horrifying pool of blood; Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana), the giant criminal thug, one of Corleone's most trusted enforcers; Tessio (Abbe Vigoda), the fearsome tall enforcer who implies the possibility of violent revenge guaranteeing Michael's safety; and Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the other faithful enforcer...With a beautiful score by Nino Rota immensely memorable, Coppola's motion picture remains a triumph, nearly perfect in its execution, composition, and impact...\n",

            "Review 32: The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department.\n",

            "Review 33: Despite having essentially no italian heritage, Marlon Brando will forever be remembered by millions all over the world as Don Corleone, the mafia boss and main character from one of the greatest movies ever made, period. When it was released in the early 70s, this film was for a time the highest grossing movie ever made and easily eclipsed the money accumulated by other movies produced that same year. Before the sequel (and the less impressive third movie), there was the original mob boss played by Brando who was just the right amount of threatening and respectable. After all these years, this movie still inspires many people around the world to become filmmakers for a number of reasons. It is very long and technically impressive to look at, employs a large number of actors and extras, has great dialogue and acting, and most importantly, has a story that never fails to entertain no matter how much time passes. As you might gather from the title, The Godfather is about the patriarch of an immensely powerful family of underworld criminals, but he is getting old, and maybe it's time for a new leader to be selected. The story begins in 1940s New York, where Vito Corleone (Brando) is attending a wedding for his daughter Connie. When Johnny (Vito's godson) wants his help in playing a part in a film, he sends a man named Tom to LA to get the part secured for him. One of the executives refuses and wakes up some time later with the severed head of a horse under his blankets. Later, around Christmastime, Vito and his family cause more crime-related incidents when someone asks him to inject more money into a drug business, which Vito turns down. One of Vito's men is strangled to death when he is sent to see what they're up to. Later, Vito is shot outside, but survives. His oldest son Sonny is now in control of the family, and his other son Michael (Al Pacino) kills two guys in a restaurant after retrieving a handgun from a bathroom that was placed there earlier. Violence erupts between Vito's family and a rival gang, which leads to many of his relatives fearing for their lives. Michael travels to Sicily, and Sonny is murdered by people armed with machine guns when he tries to kill a rival. Meanwhile in the mediterranean, Michael meets a girl named Apollonia, but she's killed when a bomb hidden in a car blows up. Vito now realizes he's in serious trouble as his rivals were able to find and kill Sonny. Basically admitting defeat, he tells the rival gang he will not oppose their heroin operation and will not take revenge for Sonny's demise. Michael marries his longtime girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) after returning home, but by the mid 50s, Vito's time is running out. He soon suffers a heart attack, and Corleone gangsters murder the rival mob bosses in New York City, all of this taking place on the same day as the baptism of Connie's child. With this accomplished, Michael is now in charge of the Corleone family, and is ready to fulfill his task of becoming just as feared as his father was. There are so many reasons why this movie is incredible that I can't possibly fit them all into a review, but one reason is that the opening wedding ceremony was recorded a few minutes from where I live. I'm not going to say where it is, but it's easy enough to find out. The casting and acting here is all remarkable, with the most prominent being Brando and Al Pacino. It's thanks to their stellar performances as Vito and Michael respectively that cemented both of them as gangster icons for decades to come. Of course, Brando was in tough guy movies before this, but The Godfather is such an enormous movie with so many different paths to take that it really elevated his status in the public eye. I've said it before but I'll say it again here. Only the very best movies can make an audience sad, smile, laugh, scared, etc. Within the confines of one story. The Godfather accomplishes all of these things. The music in this movie also fits perfectly with whatever is going on, and the theme song (I think everyone will agree) is one of the best tunes ever connected to a movie. There's many other things to discuss in detail, but if I attempted to, I'd be writing this until next year. The bottom line is The Godfather is like the Beatles of gangster films: it changed everything about the genre and basically became the yardstick by which other gangster movies are measured. It might not seem like a very fair comparison since nothing really tops this. As the decades pass, Don Corleone (whether its Vito or Michael) will continue to be seen as the very embodiment of the mafia. Coppola made sure the characters here were portrayed as sophisticated, and not like mindless criminals most people expected from a crime movie, which was a revolutionary decision. A movie this influential only comes once in a lifetime.\n",

            "Review 34: When people think of \"The Godfather\", they usually think of the Mafia. But, as Entertainment Weekly noted, calling \"The Godfather\" a Mafia movie is like calling \"The Odyssey\" a guide to the Aegean Sea. This story of how the Corleone family rules New York with their own version of justice entails everything that makes movies good.First, the opening scene. The shot of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) sitting in his chair petting his cat sets the Don up as a fatherly - but shady - figure. Then, you see Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding: the Corleones are not just a bunch of evil slime-balls. During the wedding, Michael (Al Pacino) arrives. Wearing his military uniform, Michael looks like a handsome young man - possibly an allusion to how these people are adept at deceiving other people. At the wedding, Michael meets WASP-ish outsider Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), who's naturally a little weirded out by the whole Mafia lifestyle - at one point, Michael has to tell her: \"That's my family, Kay. That's not me.\" The other two sons are Sonny (James Caan), the immature playboy, and Fredo (John Cazale), the loser. And there's also the adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), now a lawyer. After a trip to Hollywood where he unsuccessfully tries to get a producer to hire singer Johnny Fontane (who apparently was not really based on Frank Sinatra), we all know what Tom does with the horse.A scene that did a really good job showing the break between 1st and 2nd generation Americans is the scene where Michael and Kay are Christmas shopping and \"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\" is playing. Vito, as an immigrant, kept many of the traditions from his native country. Michael, born and raised in the US, certainly seems less Italian that his father.Then, of course, Vito gets shot. After Michael gets revenge, he has to hide out in Sicily. While he's there...well, we all know what happens to Sonny. This prompts Vito to negotiate with the other families. But then, Michael turns out to be even more ruthless than his father.Probably the most incredible scene is when Michael presides over the baptism of Connie's child. As soon as Michael \"renounces\" Satan, things get ugly. It basically says that every time that they say something holy, someone gets slaughtered.All in all, Francis Ford Coppola created an inimitable cinematic masterpiece. And the sequel actually managed to equal the original.\n",

            "Review 35: The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original \"Movie Brats\" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!! The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures) The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

            "Review 37: The last time I watched the Godfather I gave this movie a 7 out of 10 and I didn't particularly love it and so I was disappointed. I wasn't looking forward to sitting through this 3 hour movie once more but I'm definitely glad that I did as the second time, the whole story became so much easier to understand.The Godfather is simply a movie that deals with the crime business within the Corleone family. The summary given on IMDb doesn't seem accurate to me as it simply deals with the lives of Michael and Vito Corleone, as well as Sonny and Tom Hagen.The greatest strength in the movie is EVERYTHING! I LOVE IT! The acting in the movie is pretty much, beyond explanation with words. Marlon Brando is absolutely a genius of an actor playing Vito, one of my favorite movie characters. Al Pacino did a fantastic job playing the young war hero, Michael Corleone. The only bit of a weakness in terms of acting was Diane Keaton, but it doesn't bother me one little bit.The writing and direction in the movie is superb. Every scene is executed at top notch and this movie is simply a great explanation of what a great movie should be like and clearly defines Francis Coppola as a superb director. The dialogue is entertaining, and unlike the first time, no scene in the movie bored me one little bit. I love the whole movie and honestly, it felt half its running time The characters in the movie are just brilliantly conjured up. They are all so great in their own ways and each have their own personalities making them unique. I love Vito, Michael, Tom, Sonny, Kay, Sollozo, the corrupted cop and everyone, including such minor characters.***SPOILERS*** When Luca Brasi and Sonny were killed off, that left such a strange feeling of emotion in me. Luca Brasi seemed like such a warrior of a man and seeing that Sonny was killed when he was on his way to kill Carlo for his actions against Connie was just heartbreaking.However, no moment in movie history affected me the same way that this scene did and that is the classic scene with Marlon Brando's Vito playing with his grandson in the garden and abruptly, falling dead. It was so beautifully done. In any other movie, this scene would feel so unrealistic that you wouldn't buy it, the fact that a mob leader's final moments were playing with his grandson but here, the scene is executed to the perfect level. It is in fact, my favorite scene of the movie The scene where Connie and Carlo's character is being baptized at the end was just a brilliant scene and was great to see some bloody action at the end of the film. The final scene with Michael lying to Kay about Carlo's murder was great and when the heads of the families meet in his room and call him 'Don Corleone' is perhaps the greatest ending to any movie along with the Empire Strikes Back **END OF SPOILERS*** In conclusion, upon my second viewing, I can gladly say that the Godfather totally deserves to be called the best movie of all time in every way possible though it may not necessarily be mine. My Flickchart list reports this movie as my 6th highest and it all comes for good reason. Superb directing, action, writing, characters and story totally pay off as this 3 hour movie for me, feels more like a 90 minute film!\n",

            "Review 38: This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems \"too old or young for the part\". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem \"out of place\" or \"unconvincing\". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS \"The Godfather Saga\" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD.\n",

            "Review 39: Today, I managed to fill one of the biggest gaps in my film knowledge by watching one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed films of all time. I had picked up some of it by osmosis through references and parodies in other works but most of it was completely new to me, I'm glad to say. The acting, writing and direction are all of an extraordinarily high standard. It is a wonderfully told epic tale of family, betrayal, vengeance and a twisted sense of honour. As the title character Don Vito Corleone, Marlon Brando gives a fantastic performance which afforded him his second and final Best Actor Oscar, though he did not accept it. The Don is a fascinating character. He prides himself on being a man of honour who values loyalty above everything else and has a strict moral code, albeit an extremely warped one. The family business encompasses murder, gambling, bootlegging and widespread political and judicial corruption and yet he refuses to enter the narcotics trade as he thinks that it will be too messy and lose the family its support among the police and politicians. I generally prefer Brando when he enunciates more clearly as opposed to mumbling but he is very frightening as the soft spoken Don. Truly powerful people do not need to shout all of the time and the Don understands this. He seldom loses his temper, using violence as an instrument after a reasonable offer has been refused. He is an incredibly strong and compelling character and Brando's performance represents some of his best work. Francis Ford Coppola said that he wanted the best actor in the world to play Don Corleone, which meant either Brando or Laurence Olivier. Olivier is one of my absolute favourite actors but I can't imagine him as the Don.In his first major film appearance, Al Pacino is excellent as the Don's youngest son Michael Corleone, another wonderfully compelling character. In his first scene, we are introduced to him as a US Army captain who has just returned from the recently ended World War II. He is the outsider as he is the only member of his family to have attended college and wants no part of the family business. He instead wants a normal life with his girlfriend Kay Adams and this is illustrated by the two of them going Christmas shopping and going to see \"The Bells of St. Mary's\" – in a funny coincidence, that was the first sequel nominated for Best Picture while \"The Godfather Part II\" was the second – in the cinema. However, everything changes after the assassination attempt on the Don and Michael's first involvement with the family business when he murders Sollozzo and McCluskey in the restaurant, one of the best scenes in the film. He spends several years in Sicily, marries a young woman named Apollonia and sees her killed in a car bomb which was meant for him as part of the ongoing war between the Five Families. This experience hardens him and he begins to lose touch with his humanity. He returns to New York City to find that his family is no longer feared as it once was, given that his father has grown weak. The Corleones relocate to Las Vegas and, under Michael's leadership, attempt to legitimise the business but this is mocked by the Nevada based gangster Moe Greene, a thinly veiled version of Bugsy Siegel. It could be argued that Michael does not truly become his own man until after his father's death when he not only establishes himself as the new Don but reestablishes the Corleones as the most feared and powerful crime family. Pacino was deservedly nominated for an Oscar but for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor, which justifiably annoyed him as he had more screen time than Brando.James Caan is likewise excellent as the Don's hotheaded eldest son Sonny whose frequent outbursts provide a great contrast to the measured, reasonable approaches of both his father and Michael and whose very bloody murder provides another of the best scenes in the film. Robert Duvall is extremely good as Tom Hagen, the Don's unofficially adopted German- Irish-American son and the family's consigliere who is often the voice of reason. A very young Diane Keaton is impressive in the supporting role of the initially naive Kay, who undergoes a steep learning curve in the brilliant final scene when she realises that Michael was lying when he said that he did not have his brother-in-law Carlo killed. The film has a very strong cast overall: John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Abe Vigoda (along with Brando, one of the few non-Italian-Americans playing one in the film), Richard Conte (who was considered for Don Corleone), Richard S. Castellano, Al Lettieri, John Marley, Alex Rocco and Coppola's sister Talia Shire. Although Shire is a little over the top in the last scene, she is excellent in the extremely unpleasant scene in which Connie breaks down and Carlo beats her. The film's cinematography is beautiful. I particularly loved the frequent use of shadow and darkness. The long takes, one of my favourite film techniques, are not of the same duration as in the films of Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh but they are used very effectively. My absolute favourite scene in the film is the baptism of Connie's son Michael which is interspersed with a series of brutal murders. Not only is it shot in a fantastic way but it provides another great contrast as well as illustrating Michael's descent.Overall, this is an absolutely brilliant film which lives up to the hype.\n",

            "Review 40: Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.\n",

            "Review 41: First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought \"The Godfather\" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's \"business\" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family \"business\" to the eventual \"Don.\"It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10\n",

            "Review 42: Lately it seems, \"The Godfather\" has had a ubiquitous presence on the cable channels; not a week goes by where I don't see it listed playing at one time or another. For some reason I've never considered watching the film from start to finish since the first time I saw it during it's theatrical release back in 1972 - until today. There's a good reason why. I don't think there's ever been another movie to stay with me the way this one has over the past four decades. I remember virtually everything about it, even the minor scenes like the hit on driver Paulie and the 'sleeps with the fishes' calling card regarding Luca Brasi. Also the names - Clemenza, Barzini, Solozzo, Tartaglia; Moe Green too, even though he wasn't Italian. So effective was the magic of the film that I still have to check every now and then to see if Abe Vigoda (Tessio) is still alive (like I did today), only to find out that yes he is, still going strong at nearly ninety! Quite simply, \"The Godfather\" is, with no pun intended, the godfather of all the great gangster films, dating all the way back to 1931's \"Little Caesar\" and \"Public Enemy\". For Marlon Brando, it was the quintessential performance of American cinema, so nuanced and mesmerizing that it's impossible to forget. The movie in fact was so powerful that it literally made overnight stars of it's supporting players - Pacino, Caan and Duvall.There has been enough written about the film that I don't need to get into the story itself. I'll content myself with mentioning the scenes that literally blow me away, then and now - Sonny's job on Carlo in the middle of the neighborhood (that last kick is priceless), the mob hit on Sonny in the causeway, Michael's restaurant rubout of Solozzo and McCluskey, and the way Michael handled Tom Hagen's ouster as consigliere. The cherry topping of course is the baptismal scene, Michael renouncing Satan as he does the devil's work of eliminating the heads of the families who stood in opposition to the Corleones. Every scene of the movie is staged perfectly, yet rendered effortlessly as if it were just another day in the life.It would have been too easy to use the classic tag line in my summary above, you know, the one about making an offer that can't be refused. With \"The Godfather\", it seems that every scene is larger than life, with the total picture being even greater than the sum of it's parts. So I'll content myself with a recommendation that seems apropos by quoting Clemenza after his man whacked Paulie - \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli\". For cinema fans, \"The Godfather\" is all cannoli.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 43: Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is \"The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces\" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the \"Corleone Family Mafia\". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie.\n",

            "Review 45: Some people have called this one of the best movies of all time. I can see why they say that, although I wouldn't quite rate it that high. It does feature an interesting storyline, great acting and magnificent photography so I am not going to argue with those who place in so high, because it's understandable. It also has a memorable score.One needs to see this on a nice widescreen DVD because it's so beautifully photographed with tons of greens, grays and browns that are just beautiful. It makes me want to visit Italy. The only reason I personally didn't rate it as high as others was I didn't like any of the characters, and especially the hot-headed James Caan. When he got riddled with bullets and was done with, a la \"Bonnie & Clyde,\" that was fine with me!There isn't as much violence as people might think, if they've never seen this movie. To some, this film might be too slow, in fact. However, when the violence or something dramatic occurs it is intense and can be very brutal. Who can ever forget a guy waking up with a dead, bloody horse in his bed?!! Like a good film noir, there is a lot of tension running throughout the Godfather films. Everybody is after somebody it seems and you never know whom to trust. That's part of the downsides of living a criminal life: constant paranoia. All this is put together nicely as we become close observers of the Corleone family, its family ties and its \"business.\"Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Caan, Robert DeNiro (later in the saga), Talia Shire, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, John Cazale, Richard Castellano, on and on - quite a cast and quite a movie. I enjoyed both sequels, too.I am also fortunate to own \"The Godfather Epic\" on tape, which must be some sort of collector's item by now. It is three two-hour tapes in which Godfather I and II are sliced together and the story is presented in chronological order, instead of with all the flashbacks. It's well-done and I would have printed a review on that version, but I don't see it listed on IMDb.\n",

            "Review 46: The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw.  Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life.  There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them.   Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime.  Its really a movie about family.  The dialogue is just unbelievable.  I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is.  The music, the acting, everything.  People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way  that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.  The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie.   Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy.\n",

The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film.

            "Review 49: One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.\n",
            "For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.\n",
            "What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred \"Goodfellas\". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10\n",

            "Review 50: The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (\"I believe in America\") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas.\n",

His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.\n",

            "Review 52: It could be said that the film-adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel marked the beginning of a new era, as it established talents hitherto unknown to the wider public, including Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and director Francis Ford Coppola. Furthermore, THE GODFATHER is often thought of as a \"comeback\" to Marlon Brando, which apparently puzzled the actor himself, as he pointed out in his autobiography that he'd been doing movies without considerable intermission for the last twenty-or-so years. However, the claim may not have been so unreasonable after all, as the role of Vito Corleone made Brando truly sought-after again. By the time Brando embarked on the role, no major studios would hire him due to a reputation for being \"impossible\" to work with, and Coppola was only able to convince Paramount that the actor was simply tailor-made for the part and could not be neglected by having him do a screen-test first. Considering that Brando had once revolutionized acting in America through his raw, unmasked portrayals of Stanley Kowalski and Terry Malloy in the 1950's, this procedure may sound shocking, but once accomplished, Brando proved that he remained the king of acting in the end. His portrayal of Corleone may strike us as being somewhat of a caricature today, as it has been endlessly imitated (and parodied) since, but Brando did in fact attribute the character with far more attention to complex detail than seen in a typical movie \"gangster-boss\" up till that time. That Brando's performance has now, in the eyes of younger generations such as my own, turned somewhat into a cliché is simply the inevitable result of his initial originality.Also Pacino, Keaton, James Caan and Robert Duvall are, of course, quite outstanding in their roles. Particularly in Pacino's case, his handling of his character Michael Corleone's dramatic development as a person which is so crucial to the story, comes off as completely convincing. From being apparently a rather sympathetic character at the beginning, he changes as he becomes increasingly involved in his father's business life. It is this devoted focus on character development, as well as on how conflicting aspects of a personality interchange such as in Vito Corleone's case, that truly make the story so intriguing as it is. However, it is one thing to have a story of nearly endless potential, but this does not necessarily result in a successful cinematic interpretation of it. Other than outstanding performances, the direction of Francis Ford Coppolla is, of course, more than merely significant; even if one neglects the other qualities of the film, it may be treasured for its own sake, due to Coppolla's extremely competent, innovative techniques. There seems to be too many scenes and moments to pick out just one or two favorites; his ability to define the mood and atmosphere of a particular event through a painstaking attention to every single detail, is arguably of equal impact to the story as the performances of the actors, and make the film a visual delight. This is no less impressive when considering that THE GODFATHER was Coppolla's first major film; he was to establish himself further into the decade with other brilliant films such as THE CONVERSATION, APOCALYPSE NOW and this film's second act.When released in 1972, THE GODFATHER turned out to be, not surprisingly, one of the most widely-seen, lavishly- praised films in the history of the medium, and earned three Academy Awards out of eleven nominations (Marlon Brando's refusal to accept the award, due to the \"treatment of American Indians today by the film industry,\" has become famous in its own right). This is not to say, however, that THE GODFATHER is a film one is likely to grasp at first viewing; I, for one, did not quite understand its incredible reputation at first (though I did think it was a good film). Much as with CITIZEN KANE or BLADERUNNER, it is probably required to view THE GODFATHER through an historical context, and compare it to other films made around the same time, to get why it is so much adored. It helps matters that it's not only brilliantly made but really entertaining as well, so you're likely to have a good time no matter how you watch it.\n",

            "Review 53: There is always a risk when a film becomes a huge part of popular culture. So many of it's iconic moments and scenes are ripped off, riffed on, or parodied by countless shows and movies, that there is always a fear that the original will lose some of it's impact, and become comical and stale.The Godfather, however, disproves this. It is still a masterpiece, and always will be. The story-line proves once again how much the innocent public loves to view the lives of outright evil men, especially when they happen to be of the charming and charismatic variety. Let's look at the most iconic scene; a man chops off a horse's head, and leaves it in his owner's bed in order to scare him into submission. Oh yeah, he's one of the good guys though, so it's okay!Everything is explored in the Godfather, either directly or subtly; family politics, gangland negotiation, corrupt officials, there is no part of the mafia experience that is not pictured here, taken from the viewpoint of Michael, a character whose transition from unwilling family outsider and war-hero into the don himself really gives the film a unique perspective.Of course, for me, out of all the fantastic characters, the film is carried by Marlon Brando. There is something magnetic about his performance, a mixture of loving family man, ruthless career criminal, and sophisticated Sicilian gentleman, that is thrilling to watch. One of the all time greatest acting performances.\n",

There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change.

            "Review 55: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather (1972) is undoubtedly one of the best movies ever made because to me it was a pitch perfect mafia film that definitely compares to the greatness of Scorsese's GoodFellas (1990), and Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967) but so much better than those two great films put together. The best summary for this film would be about an aging mob boss named Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in an Oscar winning performance) who in a few years time is going to retire from his position as Godfather and pass the Corleone family leadership to his reluctant war hero son Michael (played by Al Pacino in a performance that should have won him the Oscar as 1972s best supporting actor). Besides GoodFellas and Bonnie and Clyde having the most obvious thing in common with this film is that all three films talk about the mob, and the second thing that all three films have in common is that they give people who watch them how ruthless the mob can be in real life. Though I didn't read the Mario Puzo novel I understood this film perfectly thanks to all the perfectly acted performances by Brando and Pacino, but as well as Robert Duvall as the family lawyer Tom Hagen, James Caan as Sonny, as well as John Cazale as Fredo. Coppola's film not only depicts how ruthless the mob can be in some instances but also how violent the mob can be as well as those were the perfect requirements for movies like this. The one thing I really disagreed with most with the 45th Oscar ceremony is why Marlon Brando rejected his 2nd academy award for lead acting when in this movie he gave the best performance of his entire since A Streetcar Named Desire (1951) and On the Waterfront (1954), and as to why Francis Ford Coppola didn't win the Academy Award for best director when I really do think he deserved it. But in the end this film is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish.\n",

It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times and those 178 minutes still fly by.There is little I can say that has not already been covered by other reviewers. Some movies are designed for entertainment whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also the shots of Diane Keaton that places her character Kay on the outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. Of course the famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years but cannot help doing so.The 1970s was another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking and The Godfather was one of the very best produced.\n",

            "Review 57: The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.\n",

            "Review 58: I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering.\n",

            "Review 59: \"The Godfather\" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/\n",

            "Review 60: Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended.\n",

            "Review 61: So, those of you who haven't seen it may wonder, \"What's so good about the Godfather? Why is it that this, out of every movie ever made, is considered by so many people to be one of the if not the all-time best?\" Allow me to explain as best I can. It's the kind of movie where everything is perfect. Everything. The acting, the script, the pacing, the cinematography, right down to the soundtrack. All of it.Oh, sure, it's a leisurely movie. It clocks in at just under three hours, and the plot takes a while to unfold. But it is NOT \"slow\" or \"boring.\" While not a suspense film in the traditional sense, the movie is definitely suspenseful, and I have to applaud Coppola for his excellent use of tension building. In other words, he uses the three-hour length of the film perfectly: there's not a wasted minute among these 175, not a single bit I'd take out.And besides, the acting is great. Just awesome. Brando's performance is stunning; the guy just oozes cool, as he always does. He's magnetic as Vito Corleone, arguably his most famous role ever. And, of course, Al Pacino's Michael Corleone deserves nothing but the highest of praise. It was the guy's big break, and he does a fantastic job displaying Michael's ruthless, cunning, coldly intelligent rise to power. The two of them pretty much make the movie, but even people playing bit parts give their all, resulting in a movie that makes mobsters seem very human. Special shout-out to Robert Duvall for his excellent turn as Tom \"Badass\" Hagen, and Diane Keaton (one of my favorite actresses, I'll add) as Michael's girlfriend and moral compass Kay. Having been mostly familiar with her for her roles in those classic Woody Allen movies, I had no idea she could carry a dramatic role, but she does an excellent job. And the script is just awesome, including a couple classic lines.Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" And, of course, \"He made him an offer he couldn't refuse.\" A whole ton of memorable ones. Actually, pretty much every line in this movie is quotable, and given its three-hour length, that's pretty impressive. And that theme song... oh man. One of the best ever written.A note also must be made on the baptism scene. All aspiring filmmakers should watch this movie for a lot of reasons, but for that scene in particular. The building of tension, the symbolism, the sacred-profane juxtaposition, the heart-stopping climax... perfect. The scene encapsulates everything I love about the movie into just a few minutes.And that's the Godfather for you. It's bleak, tender, touching, violent, thoughtful, occasionally horrifying (the famed horse head scene, anyone?), and sometimes even darkly funny. It's a complete masterpiece in every sense of the word. This, and its sequel for that matter, is a movie for the ages. Basically, if it's directed by Francis Ford Coppola and it's got Robert Duvall in it, you're in for a fantastic movie. That's a good rule of thumb. And the book it's based on is just as good!\n",

            "Review 62: Regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. \"The Godfather\" is a beloved classic about organised crime, and the Sicilian lifestyles in America. Of course the movie is about the building of a dynasty, a business built on death, murder and betrayal that goes on to run itself on favours and illegal pleasures. However, in this story we see the life of Don Vito Corleone (Played to a tee by the magnificent Marlon Brando), giving favours on his daughter's Wedding day. Here we see a loving, caring man who is both equally loved and feared. So far in the movie, it has had fair tension and introduced us to the family. Then all of a sudden a film-maker awakens to find his prized race horse's head under his bed sheets, and suddenly the tensions of this movie rises considerably.Without really explaining anything else (I mean I really shouldn't have to), our focus is on the youngest Corleone son Michael (Stunning work from Al Pacino). As a man of considerable morals and high grounds, how far will he be willing to go when push comes to shove? Lets just say \"Falls from grace\" is a perfect statement, befitting of this rich \"Sepia\" toned movie.Something of a Masterpiece when the film came out back in 1972. \"The Godfather\", has only gotten better of age. There are so many iconic quotes and moments in the movie, and the cast is just seriously one of the best ever put to film. James Caan I hardly recognised, and Robert Duvall was just as brilliant as always. But obviously the biggest argument is, was this movie Brando's or Pachino's? Personally, I thought Brando was just incredible as always, and totally deserved the Oscar he turned down. Both nevertheless are unforgettable on screen.The pacing was impeccable, as well as the locations that are all shot beautifully. Some part of me does feel that the film is a bit too long, however a lot does happen and instantly captivates you enough to check out the sequels. The music was fantastic, helping bring the era and authenticity out of the picture and into the deepest parts of my brain. I could listen to the \"Love theme\" all day. As said earlier, the movie is about the dynasty of the family, the business of the family and the vengeance of the family. So many themes are present and so much more are explored. Every gangster film ever made owes something to Francis Ford Coppola's efforts.Final Verdict: Probably the first modern gangster epic ever made. As director Stanley Kubrick said: \"Probably the finest cast ever assembled\". 10/10.\n",

            "Review 63: Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies.\n",

            "Review 64: One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list.\n",

            "Review 66: \"The Godfather\" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. \"The Godfather\" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5.\n",

            "Review 67: \"The Godfather's\" greatness extends beyond my ability to sing its praises, so there's not much insight I can offer. Except this: If you haven't seen the movie, and think like I did that you'll be disappointed doing so, see it anyway.I did. And I was disappointed, at least the first time I saw it. It was good, I thought, but not that good. Like this character gets killed off too quickly, or the movie spends too much time away from the main story following one character in Sicily, or that famous lilting melody I grew up with doesn't come up for over an hour. I thought it was good, but overrated.But then I saw it again. Wow, what a difference. Three hours flew so quickly, and I found myself totally immersed in the many different stories going on simultaneously, as well as the way director Francis Ford Coppola weaves them so effectively. \"The Godfather\" has this ability to hit you a completely different way when you see it again, because there's so much depth to what you see on screen at any given moment. But at the same time, unlike a lot of \"deep-thought\" pictures, it's wonderfully accessible, at least to a multiple-time viewer like me.The story at the heart of things is simple. A mafia family, the Corleones, are going through a rough patch. Don Vito (Marlon Brando) appears to be slipping as rival crime families vie to get into the narcotics market, which Don Vito has always eschewed. After one particularly rough gangster named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) makes a move on the Don, its up to Vito's previously clean son Michael (Al Pacino) to involve himself in family affairs and help Pop out.That the Corleones are the underdogs in this movie is part of its brilliant perversity. The movie gets you rooting for them, to the point where your journey becomes similar to Michael's. The corruption he embraces in pursuit of his father's salvation becomes something you root for, until at the end, when it culminates in an orgy of violence, you might like me get as pumped about it as you would be watching your favorite sports team pull out a come-from-behind win.Great dialogue, too, fantastically delivered. Everyone is so excellent in this movie, yet at the same time so understated. From the direction to the cinematography to the music, there's a quietness to the movie that's almost eerie, and does a lot to pull you in. Pacino, Brando, and Lettieri could all be big actors, but they all keep it contained here, especially Brando whose opening scene as the Don sets the bar very high. James Caan is the closest this movie has to an outsized performance, as Michael's hot-tempered older brother Sonny, but even he only boils up once in a while. The phrase \"It's not personal, it's business,\" comes up a few times in this movie, and the scary thing is it really is for them.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. And if you have already, and didn't think it was that great, see it again. You may wind up as amazed as me at what a difference a second viewing can make.\n",

            "Review 68: This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the \"Hated it\" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience.\n",

            "Review 69: No American filmmaker has had a more disappointing trajectory to his film career than Francis Ford Coppola. To have directed four of the most influential films of the 70's (the first two \"Godfather\" films, \"The Conversation,\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") and then to spend the last two decades churning out one stinky product after another (\"Peggy Sue Got Married,\" \"Bram Stoker's Dracula\", the third \"Godfather\") earns Coppola my award for Most Promising Director Who Most Miserably Failed at Establishing Himself as an Important Figure of American Cinema. But before \"Jack\" there was \"The Godfather.\" While I feel the whole \"Godfather\" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think \"The Conversation\" and \"Apocalypse Now\" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire \"Godfather\" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. \"The Godfather\" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, \"The Godfather\" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-\n",

            "Review 70: There are many mafia movies out there but The Godfather truly stands out among them. And it is not great just because it is one of the first movies in the crime genre but also because of it's great cinematography and outstanding storytelling .If you retell the plot to someone it will sound like it is extremely dull. It's just the story of how a son takes over his father's business. But the way the movie presents this plot (with many betrayals and deaths) makes it great and memorable.The acting is not always good. In some scenes it is extremely bad. Take the scene where Connie starts breaking utensils. The acting in this scene is so bad that when it comes up while I'm watching the movie, I just turn my head away. Of course I should metion that Marlon Brando and Al Pacino do a great job. Their acting is outstanding and deserves the pride it gets.The Godfather is truly a classic in the crime genre that must be on everyone's top movies list.\n",

            "Review 71: \"The Godfather\" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is \"The Godfather\" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see.\n",

            "Review 72: When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film \"a long, boring piece of crap.\" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality. Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, \"never take sides against the family.\" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-\n",

            "Review 73: The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones.\n",

            "Review 74: Spoilers herein.Building a life in film is not so much a matter of discovering the worthwhile films, but choosing which of those have the stuff worth building with. I have a clear understanding of what Scorsese is about, which I attribute to the Latin convention for storytelling. This convention is totally invested in characters, not situation or place or God help us, ideas. Scorsese's camera is attached to people, never place. His curiosity is always about people. This is a form of visual gossip that I eschew.So it is with Coppola. But his two projects (the Godfather and Apocalypse journeys) have another merit in how they work with what came before. Apocalypse is far more interesting in this respect. But `Godfather' is very clever in how it places itself. Gangster pictures began as a matter of a pretend world, and became ever more so as the genre matured. Mobsters lived in a world not unlike that of the Roadrunner,  always at a distance from reality, often winking at the audience.Coppola took his focus on the human to this genre. The film itself is no masterpiece without this placement, but is great with it. We inherit all the machinery and momentum of the genre to place behind the characters. Brando understood this, and alone is able to effect the transferral. Pacino would go on to sledgehammer his roles, but is appropriately subdued here.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching.\n",

            "Review 75: Greetings from Lithuania.To call \"The Godfather\" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already have seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that an educated cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years.\n",

            "Review 76: I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.But i never get into it.The plot is ok but i wanted more.I wanted to go deeper into the \"why\" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.They just \"looked\" and there was silence.I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called \"masterpiece\". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly \"bored\".I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself.\n",

            "Review 77: Think epic novel crossed with Mafia speak.Imagine excellent cinematography and direction, a great musical theme, violence, tragedy, spectacle, and the family, and a cast which can't be faulted, and here you have a film which fits the bill on all counts.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in one of his greatest roles, one which he supposedly didn't initially want to play) is the powerful Mafia Don we meet early in the film. He has three sons (Sonny - James Caan; Fredo - John Cazale; and Michael - Al Pacino) and a daughter (Talia Shire), and an adopted son (Tom Hagen - Robert Duvall). These are his beloved family and the centre of his world. His day job involves building his empire by making 'offers you can't refuse'.'The Godfather' was the first film in a trilogy following the fortunes of the Corleone family, and I think the best. It has some well-presented set pieces (Connie's wedding; Sonny's murder; Michael's killing of family enemies in the restaurant; the horse's head in the bed; and Vito's death while playing with his grand-child) and is extremely well-written. The novel itself was more soapy, a work of pulp fiction - the film pulls it together and gives it a bit more class.I particularly like the characterisations of Vito and his sons. Vito is assured in his role at the head of the premier Mafia family. Sonny is a vain libertine who is hot-headed. Fredo is a weak disappointment. Michael takes his place in the family when he has to (in fact throughout the three films he is shown to be far more ruthless than any of his relatives).Is 'The Godfather' the greatest film ever made? No, but it is one of the best. Certainly in the top 10 films of the 1970s.\n",

            "Review 78: In the beginning, a young war hero tells his future wife, how his father helped a successful crooner in his career, by making his manager an offer he couldn't refuse : basically threatening him to death with a gun on his head. Through a true story, he was revealing a secret that showed how menacing is his family, and how different he is. At the end, not only did he threaten his brother in law, but he killed him, and when asked by his wife, if it was true, he answered: 'no', concluding one of the most fascinating characters' arcs in a movie. What happened in between is just the greatest cinematic metamorphosis, pure magic.This is not the story of a pure soul being corrupted, but the story of a soul whose only choice in order to protect someone dear was to become like him and therefore to realize that the crime that inhabited his father's life, not only could be justified, but ultimately, was the only destiny that could allow him to succeed. This is the irony of the American Dream, of a man who parodied the capitalism to underline its own limits, the same limits that ultimately built his power. An irony that inherited his youngest son, who lost his soul for the sake of blood loyalty: losing principles for the sake of mightier principles.The fact is that some principles transcend the conventional ones, and if the father didn't want to be a puppet, he had to be the one who pulls the strings, like Presidents who don't pull the trigger, to be the ones to declare the war. More than an iconic cinematic allegory, the strings symbolize the tight frontier between being a legitimate politician and a respected criminal, in other words, being Vito Corleone. Being the master who gives you protection, in exchange of loyalty, letting you act knowingly that everything is under control. That's the point, with Vito, everything is under control. When he promises that the two thugs who brutalized a poor undertaker's daughter will get their comeuppance, we know he'll do it. Now, the question asked in the beginning is : which of his three sons will succeed to this exceptional man?The answer relies on one scene. Michael kisses his father's hand, in danger in the hospital, and tells him respectfully: \"I'm with you, Pop\" and a tear runs in Vito's face. His son is protecting him and for some reason, we're almost sure that his father will survive, just like with the undertaker. The only man who inspired the same level of confidence than Vito is his son, Michael, who's (ironically again) the civilian, the non criminal. Not because the other sons were not meant to be Dons, the older one was Sonny, hot headed, good hearted, the other was as good hearted but weaken minded, both were criminals in a way or another. Michael was the one because he had to be. More than a story of succession, it's a story of destiny.And \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest evolutions that ever enriched the silver screen. Mainly because of this story that everyone could relate to, one who loved his family and whose only choice was to corrupt his soul to protect it. It's not about crime, it's about the very necessities that make crime, not legitimate, but justifiable. It's not about crime; it's about its roots. It's not a crime or gangster movie, it's a movie where the crime setting highlights some principles like blood loyalty, friendship, or family that would have been meaningless in a more legitimate world. This is the thought provoking genius of \"The Godfather\", that made it so universally appealing, because people from every cultures respect values like courage, loyalty, family, and respect itself.The nature of the story is just one of the pillars on which the greatness of \"The Godfather\" has built its legend ... and I focused on this because the rest has not to be proved: the acting, the direction, the music, the quotes, the characters, the cinematography  every analyzable element is a living proof of the movie's closeness to perfection. Why should I develop this? If you read these lines, you know what I'm talking about, so let's keep this prudish and not try to be too enthusiastic. How ironic that the movie was based on a kind of pulp fiction novel  How ironic that the direction that made the movie with such confidence was so imperceptible  Indeed, Coppola makes us feel as part of this family, of the Corleones, they are criminals, yes, but the intimacy helps us to root for them  But another irony is that the direction is still present by these little details that gave the film its legendary feeling, every single death occurring has a little something that makes it memorable, from Khartoum's decapitation, to Sonny's ambush, from the restaurant to the baptism scenes, not to forget the two strangulations that opened and concluded the human deaths' series. The details are everywhere, in the script that enriched the cinematic language with so many iconic quotes, from delightful culinary parallels to other fishy metaphors  a script that transcended the novel, and made the film even more legendary.When it comes to defend \"The Godfather\", I'm the most passionate fan you'll ever find, but I prefer to prevent this review from an overdose of superlatives. I know the movie is the greatest, not because it's my personal belief, but because I can't see another movie to top it, whatever cinematic category I use : story, acting, casting, writing, scoring, editing, direction  I can find a movie better in every element but not in all of them, and beyond all this technicality  it's just a movie that grows on you, after so many viewings, that shines cinematic respect in every single frame. The greatest\n",

            "Review 79: The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence. The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/\n",

            "Review 80: Really what more about The Godfather can I say that hasen't already been said?Everything about this movie is perfectly executed and incredibly well put together. The characters are really what added that extra depth to the film. The first character I want to bring up is Sonny. Throughout the movie, you know him as an ignorant and almost childish person, yet when he is shot and killed, you feel immediate sympathy for him. And at the same time he is a determined member of their family business and also caring when the time is needed for that trait to be exposed (ex: when Vito nearly dies in the first act). And when Vito is looking down at his dead body, you really feel for them even though someone like Vito may come across like an incredibly serious and emotionless man. But what they accomplished was, not making him another one dimensional Mafia/mob boss, but someone who legitimately cares for his family. The way they introduce him in the beginning of the film is very well conducted and shows the audience how intimidating he is and the impact he has on other people in what he says and how his word/opinion is extremely important to people. Brando is incomparable in his role and is irreplaceable as his role as Don Corleone.My favorite aspect of this movie, however, is seeing the riveting transition of Michael Corleone throughout the film. They first introduce Michael as someone who wants nothing to do with the family business, but is eventually the new Don replacing his father at the end of the film. Wow! What a transformation! He is a former Marine who is committed to living a normal, happy life with his wife Kay. However Michael eventually gets involved in the criminal empire after Vito is shot and almost killed. This leads up to the best scene, in my opinion, of the movie. Michael goes out to a restaurant with Sollozzo, the head of one of the rival families of the Corleones, the Tattaglias, in addition to Police Captain McCluskey, with intentions to kill both of them. He does after contemplating it in his head, and this is an incredibly important scene because it is the start of Michael's transition into the new Don we see at the end of the movie. It was not rushed in any way and that's another great aspect of the film. It's nearly three hours long, but it's necessary for the person watching it to be fully immersed into the story and characters. The ending is really well directed and thought out because without any explanation, you know what just happened as soon as someone kisses Michael's hand, which was shown earlier in the film but to Vito, a gesture only given to the Don. Al Pacino gave a great performance and so did every single other person in the movie. Perfect casting all around.I think one performance that is very undervalued is Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen. He plays a super important role in the movie, but is not quickly thought of by most people. He was a side character, but incorporated well in the film as the advisor for Vito, and later Michael.Many Of the characters in the movie and constantly conflicted with themselves and they display it very well. The entire story is one of the best ever put to the big screen and the praise that it's gotten over all these years are very deserving. The way they utilize lighting in the film is also very important such as every scene of Vito in his office at the beginning of the film is constantly lit dark showing the fear people feel when entering his office and the seriousness of situations involving him. This also applies to Vito's soft spoken voice demonstrating how intimidating he comes off as without screaming for example. A vast majority of the film, basically the entire 2nd and 3rd acts, with the exception of the very beginning with the wedding to go also how with the 1st act, are all lit dim, in dark tones. On the other hand, Michael, in the beginning of the film, is shown in the bright daylight outside talking with his girlfriend, an excellent contrast between him and the rest of his family.Great acting, great script, and all put into great hands that made it as amazing as it is even 40 years later.RATING: 10.0/10\n",

            "Review 81: Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 82: So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies.\n",

            "Review 84: \"The Godfather\" has been a title so beloved and entirely embraced as a significant, cultural phenomenon, that in a certain level demands of you to watch it with full recommendations off of it. Especially if you're young, there is absolutely no way that the buzz of the \"greatest movie in history\" did not get you. So, even though that buzz doesn't necessarily ruin the viewing for you all-together, I will accept that while I was watching, I was unintentionally trying to like it and feel it.The beginning of the film sets the mood perfectly. There are no attachments to settled humor or dry dialogue. It warns us that this is going to be a serious take, on some pretty serious issues. Don Corleone's first lines are self-aware and carefully put. This dominating appearance shows us a man trusted, beloved and respected and at the same time feared, depressed and deserted. And that goes for both his family and outsiders. He is a mafia man, one of the greatest, and his life is surrounded by his business partners, by his associates and comrades in this dark lifestyle. And throughout the entire movie, he is presented to have balanced the time between family and business, yet that seems like one impossible task. Micheal Corleone, son of the Godfather, is introduced like a man with a very different approach and very different opinions on the case of life and choices than the rest of his family and especially his father. That happens for two reasons: early on his life he decided not to be like him (even though he seems to be the one attached by the Godfather as the favorite) and he has chosen a decent life for him and Kay, the love of his life. Then, everything goes down the drain: someone attempts to kill the Godfather. It is at that point when the son Micheal starts his decay... No promises, no commitments, no wrongs... Someone tried to kill his loving father. He stares at every single person in his family just standing by, so in his rage, decides to do the unthinkable. Using his status as the most innocent of the Corleone family, he exacts revenge.When he succeeds, he exiles himself out of the country until things can settle down. He attempts to start a new life away from the madness with Apollonia, a beautiful woman he meets and falls in love with (although never convincing even himself that he has forgotten Kay). He comes to know the hard way that he can't run away from what he has done and what his family stands for. Someone tries to kill him even so far from his home but gets to Apollonia. So upon his return, he accepts the position of the new \"Godfather\" and immediately seems to be a changed man.Micheal retrieves Kay, makes unconditional promises and ends up being the very person he was trying to avoid.There are several things in this film that make it astounding. Relationships within the family are displayed in such a truthful way. Francis Ford Coppola offers us a chance to connect with many different characters and their several views. The main plot is driven excellently, with Don Corleone and Micheal taking the grandeur, but in the meanwhile we get to know the deep motions and powers of every person slightly connected to this world. What we get is a fiery and passionate film exploring deep meanings and strong notions. Marlon Brando won the Academy Award for what was an unbelievably great performance. After this film, I totally get his worldwide fame as one of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino shines with charisma (which he perfected on the second part) in the greatest role of his career. And besides these two super-actors, is there anyone from the cast that I can talk badly for? All great.I guess the only issue with this movie is it's running-time and most importantly the somewhat complicated way things glue together. I understand that Mario Puzo had a difficult task of bringing the book on- screen, but it's the way we are drawn to these characters that makes me confused about who is who. And that is the reason I suggest we stick to the father-son relationship and not worry about certain aspects and scenes we don't understand or just keep asking \"who is that guy talking\"?This is the \"Godfather\" that everyone is talking about for decades, and if you don't like what you hear in the very first scene in that dark room, I warn you... turn of the picture and don't watch anymore. Come back a few years later when you could probably handle it.On the other hand, you must ask yourself: can you feel the zest for respect and loyalty when Don Corleone whispers his lines? Don't you yearn for the moral and innocent Micheal as the movie goes? Can you sympathize with Kay when the door closes at the end? Then \"The Godfather\" got you where it should have.\n",

            "Review 85: The Godfather (1972) did for gangster movies what 2001: A Space Odyssey did for science fiction. Like Stanley Kubrick, Francis Ford Coppola re-energized and, to a degree, reinvented a basic Hollywood pulp fiction action-entertainment genre, using it as a vehicle for the high artistic ambitions of a post-New Wave film \"auteur.\" Within his narrower focus on 20th century American civilization (as opposed to Kubrick's philosophical speculations on human evolution), Coppola shapes the story of the Corleone Mafia family into an epic/satiric vision of American business, government, justice, and moral decline. The Godfather's brilliantly constructed opening sequence, the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter, not only establishes the Don's character, the nature of his organization, the role of family and Sicilian tradition in his world, and the character of his sons (three natural and one adopted), but also establishes the relationship between the Don's world and \"legitimate\" society. For instance, the film's opening words are those of Bonasera, a petitioner for a wedding \"favor,\" whose voice over a dark screen first asserts the American Dream, \"I believe in America. America has made my fortune,\" and then turns to disillusioned contradiction: \"for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.\"Numerous subsequent lines of dialog establish literal or metaphorical connections between the criminal underworld and social institutions. Some of the most memorable ones include: \"My father is no different than any powerful man, any man with power, like a president or senator.\"\"Now we have the unions, we have the gambling; and they're the best things to have. But narcotics is a thing of the future. And if we don't get a piece of that action, we risk everything we have. I mean not now, but ten years from now.\" \"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business.\" And most famously of all: \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" The film's title refers to two godfathers, the original Don Corleone and his youngest son - and ultimate successor - Michael. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Corleone, for which he was awarded a Best Actor Academy Award, balances the Don's subtly counter-pointed functions as beloved, grandfatherly patriarch and fearsome, brutal crime boss. Yet Michael, as the character most centrally and significantly affected by the film's plot and played with a brilliance equaling Brando's by a then unknown Al Pacino, is the principal protagonist.At the wedding, Michael's centrality is signaled by the Don's frantic call, \"Where's Michael? We are not taking the picture without Michael!\" A World War II hero still in decorated uniform, Michael is meanwhile busy differentiating himself from his family to his girl friend and future second wife, Kay (Diane Keaton). \"Luca Brasi held a gun to the band leader's head,\" he relates, \"and my father assured him that either his signature or his brains would be on the release. That's my family Kay. It's not me.\" Michael's initial disinterest in Mafia activities is reinforced by his adoring father who envisions him as \"Senator Corleone\" or \"Governor Corleone\" not as his successor. That role is reserved for his hot-headed eldest son, Sonny (James Caan). But, of course, events conspire to suck Michael in - and to keep sucking him in right through Godfather III - the assassination attempt on his father, Michael's coolly murderous response, the car bomb meant for him that kills his first wife, the Sicilian beauty Apollonia (aptly named for the god of sun light), the riddled body of his brother Sonny. Inevitably, a morally darkened Michael emerges at the end of the film, one who outdoes his father in guile and ruthlessness and whose final brutal and deceitful acts in Godfather I seal his doom as a Macbeth-like villainous tragic hero.Shot mainly on location in various New York City locales, The Godfather spans a ten-year post World War II period. A multitude of props, costumes, and pop culture artifacts arranged by the film's art director, Warren Clyner, and production designer, Dean Tavoularis, lend a rich sense of historical authenticity to the film's mise en scene. Moreover, the film's lighting by brilliant cinematographer Gordon (\"prince of darkness\") Willis, contributes greatly to both the film's realism and its thematic symbolism. Compare, for instance, the use of extremely dark, shadowy, color desaturated interior scenes  especially in the Don's home office  with the brightly lit, vivaciously colored outdoor wedding scene or the sun-drenched, romanticized Sicilian landscape.The Godfather is edited in the classic Hollywood invisible style, subordinating technique to the needs of narrative and visual continuity. But the film is expertly edited nonetheless. In particular one might note the stunning use of multiple parallel editing that occurs in one of the film's last scenes: the assassination of the other crime family heads, elaborately planned to coincide with Michael's participation in the baptism of sister Connie's child. Likewise, The Godfather's soundtrack is a memorable combination of diegetic period music (\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\") and a lush, operatic original score composed by one of the greatest film music composers, Nino Rota (a frequent Fellini collaborator as in 8 1/2).With The Godfather and its even more ambitious sequel, Coppola pushed the classic gangster film in the direction of high art and released it once and for all from the moralistic grip of the Hays Code, which arose in the 1930s in large part as a response to the romanticizing of criminals found in such early examples of the gangster genre as Scarface, Little Cesar, and Public Enemy. Not only did the code regulate the degree and nature of sexual and violent imagery in all films, but it also specifically required that criminals be portrayed as morally repulsive social deviants and that plots involving them be resolved with the implicit or explicit lesson that \"crime did not pay.\" Fortunately for American popular culture The Godfather radically rewrote the rulebook and paved the way for a generation's-worth of gangster masterpieces ranging from the Scarface remake to Pulp Fiction to The Sopranos.\n",

            "Review 86: The Godfather is regarded as one of the greatest films of them all and it's not difficult to see why. It is a bit cliché to like this movie, but it really does deserve it. Al Pacino plays the son of the head of a crime family who, following an assassination attempt on his father, rises up to become the head of the family, despite previously wanting nothing to do with his family's criminal activities. Aside from the slightly excessive length and the fact that the film made the memory of Al Pacino humiliating himself in Jack And Jill even more painful, The Godfather is one of the few films which could be seen as borderline perfect. Like many great movies, it requires patience. The film draws its audience in slowly as it gets better and more intense as it progresses and by the extremely sad ending there is a sense of awe and genuine astonishment at the quality and power of the movie. It beats Citizen Kane, the other general choice for the best movie ever made. One of the first things to set it apart is the amazing cast, although Marlon Brando is a bit difficult to understand.The direction is excellent as well, as Francis Ford Coppola's filmmaking isn't showy and visually stunning like in Apocalypse Now, but it's more subtle and restrained and draws the viewer in. The dramatic moments are handled brilliantly, and having a great script to work with certainly doesn't hurt either. What makes the film a success isn't any of the above, but the storyline. The story is perfectly structured, and gets better and better as the film progresses. Not only does it have a multitude of brilliant movie moments, it also has many jaw dropping and startling outbreaks of violence, with the multiple assassinations/baptism finale being one of the best movie moments in the history of the medium. Michael Corleone's conversion into the head of his crime family is very sad, and the movie is overall proof that a family drama can still be thrilling, moving and have people queuing around the block. I don't usually agree with the best picture winners, but this is one which totally deserved to win. Like I said earlier, it's a cliché to love this movie but it really does deserve it.10/10\n",

            "Review 87: I never liked the IMDb top 250 list. So i haven't thought about this one for a very long time. Then i watched Shawshank and immediately became a fan. Somewhere i read that Godfather was at the top of the 250 before Shawshank and that's when i decided to take a chance with Godfather. I wasn't a fan of gangster flicks so it's fair to say i never thought i'd sit through all 3 hours and minutes. What can i say? This film changed every thing about my taste in movies. After watching this i ended up as a fan of gangster movies and i went on to watch some pretty old movies and some of the longest running films. (And now i am a fan of IMDb's 250)I had a go at this movie again (for the 5th time)yesterday and compelled to write a review here.I'm not gonna say anything new here after all these 1687 reviews but anyone reading this i guess you probably watched the movie and inspired enough to read the reviews here. If that so give me a thumps up! In my opinion The Greatest Gangster Film ever. And Arguably the greatest movie of all time. 10 out of 10.\n",

The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P.

            "Review 89: This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people \"sleeping with da fishies\" or \"making an offer you can't refuse,\" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)\n",

            "Review 90: A family, the Don, everyone knows him, everyone knows of his power, here is the end of his era and simply the beginning of another, we a fantastic look into a family, into a style of life. It begins and we see who Vito Corleone is, we see another man who shares some things with Vito, both are Italians now established in America, that other man believes in the country that gave him and his family a fine life certainly, here you see what the Corleone family can do. And is a wonderful contrast, is the life the Corleone family, Vito ordered for justice and next he is dancing with his daughter. Family and the business, so in the business part we meet Sollozzo, big nose Italian, great businessman, narcotics are the future and Sollozzo knows that to get to that bright future Vito is important. And all is simply because of don't keeping you very own thoughts with you, every one knew that narcotics means dollars, Vito's son and right hand Tom Hagen, Vito's eldest son Santino but the decision was only of Vito. Then this is a terrific story, logic and business, \"nothing personal\", here Michael Corleone will enter, not to the film certainly but to the business. As any other character Michael is really interesting, here we know that he is a war hero, he is not like his family but certainly he knows the world of his family, he was born in that world. Basically during the very first part of the film we see Michael as a normal man with his former girlfriend Kay, buying Christmas presents, going to the cinema, having dinner and stuff. Soon we will see him in Sicily but before we see his first contact with the business part, obviously he suffered like Santino or Tom when he saw on the newspaper that Vito Corleone was shoot and that was still unknown if he was dead or alive so basically is this what puts Michael closer to the business part. So this is the very beginning of a new era but we don't know that yet, after all Michael was going to have a meet with Sollozzo and his dirty police officer because he was a civilian, not related with the family business. Is a great scene, the very best of Pacino in this film so Sollozo and his dirty police officer are dead, a new \"chapter\" in The Godfather begins, another engaging part of the film, for me each second of The Godfather is wonderful. So we for the first time see Sicily, there Michael is just waiting, there he meets a beautiful girl, she becomes his wife, certainly there are news from New York, Santino was killed (an emblematic scene), the future of Michael is only one. The last time we see Vito as the Don we see him together with Tattaglia, Barzini, Cuneo and Stracci, after this Vito realizes about something and that will save Michael's life. He is still the Don for the men of the Corleone family but certainly if they trust in Vito and are loyal to Vito they must trust in Michael and be loyal to Michael who at the time was already father, Anthony the name of his son, together with Anthony Vito is laughing, enjoying a normal time with his grandson, the most unexpected death thinking in Don Vito Corleone after the life he had, he always had honor, love for his family, he died in a peaceful way, playing with his grandson, in his house, if that would have been an offer certainly would have an offer he can't refuse. The cast is simply perfect, the voice of Brando, the strange charisma of James Caan as Santino, one of Pacino's best performances, simply each actor/actress is fantastic giving life to all those memorable characters. My very first experience with The Godfather was not a really long time ago, was in 2005 and I came to them together with some members of my family who like me had never seen by then any of the three films, I loved The Godfather and in 2006 I read the novel by Mario Puzo. I remember not having clear in my mind each detail of the film when I started reading the novel, by then I had seen only once The Godfather. I loved the novel and after reading it I went to another one by Puzo, The Last Don and I loved it also. So after this I remember having this sort of Mafia summer by watching first the miniseries based on The Last Don and later watching again The Godfather trilogy. This film has become the one I love the most, its long runtime feels like nothing, I watched it a lot of times back in 2006 once I had read the novel, fantastic. I received for Christmas the Coppola Restoration four-disc set on Blu-ray, while I haven't seen yet Part II and III (and the new bonus material) on Blu-ray this part looks so beautiful, in short you remember how it looks the blood of Moe Greene (during that memorable baptism sequence)? Well on Blu-ray it finally looks like blood!PD: my very first IMDb comment was precisely for The Godfather. While I'm not at all ashamed or anything like that about it I don't like it either so I decided to delete it and write another one. I was going to put it here just because it was my very first comment but thanks to the words limit I can't. I will put it on my message board profile.\n",

What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week.

            "Review 92: Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker.\n",

My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though.\n",

The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film.

            "Review 96: Adapted from a Mario Puzo novel, The Godfather has had the most extreme change in views for me, until a couple of weeks I despised it but that was before I rewatched it and now I love it. I think my hate for it was based on when I first saw it at the age of about 16, I really wasn't mature to appreciate the sheer beauty of The Godfather. When released it became of the biggest grossing movies of the 70's and it's no hard to see why. There are so many great aspects of The Godfather. The characters are just so well etched out. The story centres around the Corleone family who are involved with the underworld and their fight to gain supremacy of the underworld over a couple of decades. There is Don Corleone, who maybe an underworld figure but is a man of principle. An example of that is in the scene where he refuses to start selling drugs. Then there is Sonny,who is a far more ruthless man than his father. Micheal, who is the good son is working towards a respectable career. Their worlds turn upside down when Don is almost killed by rival. Sonny takes over the family business and wants revenge. Micheal gets his hands dirty by gunning down the rival(in the famous restaurant scene). Micheal is forced to flee the country so that he can avoid going to jail. Sonny is then eventually killed by rivals and Micheal is forced to run the business. After a few murders Micheal becomes as much of a ruthless mobster as his deceased brother Sonny. What is so remarkable is how family life and business life are intertwined so beautifully. In the beginning at the wedding for instance when they decide to do favours for their guests. All the leads were extraordinary,my personal favourite being Marlon Brando as Don Corleone. There are very few movies that can still shock audiences thirty years after they were first released, The Godfather is one of those rare movies. The scene in which a producer finds his beloved horse in bed with him was deeply disturbing. The Godfather I believe stands heads and shoulders above any Gangster movies because The Godfather is not just about the Mafia, it's also about family. I think most of the credit for the Godfather should go to Francis Ford Coppola. I regard The Godfather to be one of the most remarkable and iconic movies ever made and all the people involved with it should be applauded. Highly recommended to lovers of classic cinema.\n",

            "Review 97: I was fortunate to see \"The Godfather\" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many \"gangster\" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about \"family\" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have \"The Godfather\" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a \"gang family\" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me \"One From The Heart\", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as \"Peggy Sue Got Married\", another \"family\" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. \"The Godfather\" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story.

I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile.\n",

            "Review 104: THE GODFATHER (1972) **** Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, John Cazale, John Marley, Talia Shire, Richard Conte, Abe Vigoda, Richard Castellano, Richard Bright, Al Martino, Alex Rocco. Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece of cinema and one of the most memorable films of all time: Brando (Best Actor) gives a superb performance as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a Long Island crime family who faces all sorts of dilemmas, most of which embroil his youngest son Michael (Pacino in a star-making role), fresh from WWII, who takes on the awesome task of being the next leader in crime, violence and double-crossing. Great ensemble cast and some truly remarkable moments captured on film: offering film studio head Marley \"an offer he can't refuse\" resulting with a horse's head in bed; assassination attempts and successes (Caan's hot-tempered Sonny buying the farm at a toll booth massacre the likes of \"Bonnie and Clyde\") and the piece de resistance of baptism of Michael's' godson and the wiping out of his enemies is the stuff of Greek legend. Pure filmmaking at its best. Oscar winner for Best Picture, adapted screenplay by Coppola and Mario Puzo (from his best seller) and some beautiful cinematography by Gordon Willis (suggesting a Rembrandt painting come to life). Pacino, Caan and Duvall were all nominated for Best Supporting Actor (all losing to Joel Grey in \"Cabaret\"). Kudos also to make-up guru Dick Smith for his realistic old age make up on Brando and also to Nina Rota's famous haunting foreboding score.\n",

            "Review 105: The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history.\n",

            "Review 106: 'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive \"family honour.\" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul.\n",

I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason.

Acclaimed?) but still annoying, and i was disappointed to find he still had a part to play in the film, even after the film maker's had him shot.The movie does have some fine moments (the horses head, Pacino's restaurant scene, Sonny's death) all good scenes, but when interlaced with tediously drawn out rubbish (The opening 20mins YAWN, Pacino's entire time spent in hiding, YAWN) I couldn't help but wish for the film to end.At nearly 3 hours long, the movie could have easily been trimmed by a hour and not lost anything, in summary this film has brilliance mixed with tedium and simply doesn't deserve its place in the number 1 spot.I hope part 2 is better, because part 1 has not inspired me to watch it, maybe when i have nothing else to do i will.

            "Review 112: The Godfather soaks us up so dry it never has to hustle through. There is something in the deliberate journey of time as Don Corleone entrusts his reins of power that would have made an hour-and-forty-minute-long thriller unbecoming. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you understand merely by the way they exchange looks, or don't, or speak to each other. We are inclined to associate with Don Corleone's family not because we enjoy their gang wars, but because we have been with them from the opening, where they celebrate a wonderful wedding full of old Italian songs, dances and love, and later we watch them await violence while sitting at the kitchen table and eating the pasta cooked by Clemenza.Endowed with Nino Rota's immortal, extraordinary music score, this consummate masterpiece is entitled The Godfather, a title not only relevant because of the wise Don Vito Corleone, who heads his family with unruffled effectiveness, but also to his son Michael, a hesitant college graduate who is in the beginning feeling shame of his criminal background and firm on living the life of an upright citizen. Coppola follows Michael's ascent to power within the family, on top of the concurrent wearing away of his heart.Vito Corleone himself is not even the central character in the drama. He is a relaxed puppeteer. The central character, really, slowly comes to be the youngest, smartest son, Michael, who absorbs the spirit of his father's standing while reworking his outdated customs. The Godfather's function in the family enterprise is illustrated by his name, existing outside the following generation which will continue and, with any luck, point the family into legal endeavors. Marlon Brando, who plays Vito as a perceptive, resilient model family man in his wise latter years, in fact has the character lead whereas Al Pacino, as Michael, is the lead. Unhurried and physically at ease, one knows his reaction would be of great anger if he were to be harassed. In the face of his grooming, which is given the least effort needed for a good, attractive look, there's a look about him as if he's just awakened, and that first groggy morning hour is the time he always seems to be stuck within. His presence is imprinted with a brooding, nonchalant style. Smooth and understated, he musters a searing inner fire that makes his tremendous character arc so impactful and amazing. But Brando's performance, as always, is expertly offhand, and it earned him an Oscar. His voice and physicality consciously lack precision, and the incidental result is of a man so at home with power that he no longer needs to prompt anyone.The remaining actors furnish one case-in-point after another of superb, instinctive casting. Macho and tempestuous James Caan and pragmatic and down-to-earth Robert Duvall, for instance, hardly have to act to embody their roles. While this, the quintessential crime drama, is an extensive, painstakingly thorough film of nearly three hours, there genuinely isn't time to go into the personal history and distinctiveness of such characters as Clemenza (Richard Castellano), the hardened, heavyset family lieutenant, Jack Woltz (John Marley, who was excellent in Faces), the movie baron, Luca Brasi, the faithful contract killer, McCluskey (Sterling Hayden), the corrupt cop, and the rest. Coppola meets this issue head-on with unassuming typecasting. A character who appears in a story long enough to say hello and goodbye, no matter how small, better be real enough that you can assume who he votes for.Really, the opening wedding sequence deeply familiarizes us with the dynamics of the family, an authoritarianism in the guise of Old World ceremony. Coppola asserts a style and a visual guise that is quintessential, through Gordon Willis's reddish-brown tinted, overexposed cinematography, everything period furnishings.Men wearing black suits sitting in dark boardrooms parley the particulars of prostitution and gambling, and fashion an isolated society that issues stability and integrity, that is in terms of their own advantages. Politicians and policemen are merely intimidated or trafficked. Esteem and reliability are the legal tender, and all influence emerges from the Don, who calmly keeps quiet control over his territory.His successor is Santino, the Caan role, always cooking with implicit rage and is incredibly eager to inherit the position. His brothers are Michael and the sniveling pushover Fredo, played by the late John Cazale. The Duvall role is Tom Hagen, the unemotional, factual family lawyer and all-around professional shrewd pragmatist embraced by Vito as a child and brought up as his own. The women are not much more than background scenery. Vito's wife scarcely speaks or even appears. Sonny's wife suffers silently through his shameless infidelity, and the Corleone daughter, Connie, played by Talia Shire, is so often overlooked that her brothers take no notice of her unless she protests about her disgusting husband having beaten her.An assault on Vito's life alters Michael's attitude, and he comes back to help defend his family's wellbeing as Sonny takes rash control, making a mess of the business and laying everyone on the line, while the laid up and incapacitated Vito can do no more than look on. Michael's bona fide defining moment make its mark in one of the film's most unforgettable scenes of ultimate virtuosity. He takes it upon himself to do a hit at a small Italian restaurant, using a gun that was left for him in a bathroom stall. This forces him into banishment in Sicily, where he solidifies his determination to return his family to a status of eminence.\n",

It does indeed deserve it's reputation as one of the best movies of all time, however based on the fact it was number 1 on the IMDb top 250 i was a tad disappointed. I was fascinated by it's very engrossing story telling, the absolutely stunning performances and the incredible direction from Francis Ford Coppola . It's a pretty powerful movie with a lot of disturbing moments. It starts of a little slow but once it gets going it never fails to grip you. The direction is Incredible. Apart from the slow beginning the direction is flawless, with an EXCELLENT pace,awesome camera work and the way the camera moved with the characters it was great!, plus he created a great atmosphere!. There is LOTS of bloody violence. We get LOTS of EXTREMELY bloody gunshot wounds, knife in the hand, bloody gunshot wound to the head,severed horse head in someone's bed (VERY bloody), a harsh beating and , an very gory gunshot wound to the eye. The Acting is some of the best i have ever seen. Marlon Brando without a doubt deserved his Oscar for his groundbreaking performance, however having said all that Al Pacino deserved the Oscar just as much, it also was hard to understand what Brando was saying at times!. Al Pacino's performance was just as good and was also deserving of The Oscar, he and Brando had some cool scenes together and watching Pacino was just plain fun to watch!. James Caan was EXCELLENT here in his scenes here and wish he had more screen time , he is a terrific actor!. Robert Duvall is very good here with what he had to do i liked him lots. Diane Keaton is excellent here as Pacino's wife and had awesome chemistry with Pacino. Talia Shire was very good here but went a little crazy at times and she sure broke a lot of dishes! (LOL, and the rest of the cast did a tremendous job as well. Overall this indeed a true classic and one of the best movies out there however i was expecting a little too much and was a tad disappointed however i HIGHLY suggest you buy or rent this now just don't go in expecting it to be the best of all time (although a lot of viewers will probably think it is). ***** out of 5\n",

            "Review 115: The Godfather is Franis Ford Coppolla's best work (next to Apocalypse Now) and is one of the best films I have ever seen. It shows a way of life not shown before this film was released and most likely it shocked them as much as it shocked me. The Acting (among many other things) highlight this film-noir/gangster/epic including Marlon Brando in his most recognizable performance ever as the man himself, Don Corleone, but also subtle work from breakthrough star Al Pacino and others like James Caan, Robert Duvall, and great bit parts for wonderful character actors like John Marley and Sterling Hayden.Corleone gets wounded and, by default through various 'circumstances' in the family (not least of which his ailing health) hands his \"business\" over to his ambivalent but cunning son, Michael (in a well done performance by Al Pacino). The film goes on long, but after watching it a few times, you hardly notice it at all. Every time ones watches this film it gets better because of noticing something small, something wildly creative, one didn't notice the last time and thanks to that it gets richer every time. With a beautiful score, terrific cinematography, and sublime directing and writing by Coppolla (with Puzo) this film belongs not only a place in film history, but in world history as well.\n",

            "Review 120: I know I will be in the minority with this review, but I think \"The Godfather\" and in particular Marlon Brando's performance are completely over rated. I'm not saying it's a bad movie at all, it's a good one, but I don't think it lives up to the hype.Plot In A Paragraph: The Godfather \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect but is ruthless against those who do not. But a powerful and treacherous rival wants to sell drugs, and Vito refuses his permission or help. What follows is a clash between Vito's old values and the new ways which may cause his youngest son Micheal (Al Pacino) to do the thing he is most reluctant in doing, and join the family business.I found it to be over long and very drawn out. Sometimes a movie nearly three hours long, can feel like an hour and a half, as it is the engrossing and enjoyable the time flies by. This felt like I spent five hours watching it. With the exception of Brando, all the cast are superb. And I don't mean that as a slant at Brando, he does what Brando does. No more no less. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall are all excellent as is Talia Shire (in my second favourite role of hers, behind Adrian in \"Rocky\") and Diane Keaton. Ridiculously quotable, and still a movie I think everyone should see once. It's just over rated\n",

I should thank my father for this, because as kids, we watched what he watched and it formatted me for ever: the music, the pride and honor of the family, their confidence find a resonance in me, even though their heart are deeply corrupted by evil and they pay the price by the death of all dear ones! What's the point of getting rich and powerful if it to live alone ? You can read my review of the \"The Last Don\" for an in-depth analysis because the thematic background is the sameBrando is wonderful as an old Don and he looks like my late grandfather. As we haven't time to spend time together, I am sure I take Vito as an idealized root! What caught my eyes in this first movie was that: - the story takes place just after WWII (and not in 60 or 70) - it's Christmas time just as the projection - the dementia greed of Vito who wants a son to be President! - Their way of getting at the top: when they are denied help, they kill & when they are asked for help, they exchange it for a favor! It's far from streets tugs who ransom people!So, as it is maybe the best movie ever made, you should see it and it's an offer you can't refuse!\n",

            "Review 122: I can understand on why \"The Godfather\" is being regarded as one of the greatest motion pictures of all time, if not the greatest by some professionals. \"The Godfather\" is the soul of a perfected cinema, one that will be looked upon by passionate students, and one that will be studied for generations. It is the ultra-American movie classic, which shares its place alongside movies like \"Casablanca\" and \"Citizen Kane\". Even its formidable sequel never holds the same kind of stature. To admire \"The Godfather\", is to celebrate American cinema, or just simply movies.Some time ago, I told a friend that \"The Godfather\" is a great example of a 'complete' movie, and my opinion stays in that manner still. It has everything a movie requires: cinematography, acting, editing, screenplay, directing and obviously, a glorious plot. 'Overrated' is the term adopted by some for \"The Godfather\", and my assumption is that either he dislikes the picture, or he lacks the understanding to realise the wonders of the medium. \"The Godfather\" is the first great film I caught. It is the initiator of my love for cinema. Undoubtedly, the film will always have a special place in my heart.What began and seemed like a happy family, plunges into darkness too quickly. The joy and light at the beginning are merely silhouettes of the Corleone family. Sonny's (James Caan) trifling with adultery, and the show of his temper, a man asking for murder, an unholy loyalty, and Michael's (Al Pacino) telling of his father's ways of abusing power - all these are signs shown by Coppola on the dangers that will rain down upon them. One who flirts with sin, will face a punishment.Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), who is the head of the family, is a very powerful and influential figure. With considerable loyalty that his friends pay for him, he holds the power to accomplish his ambitions. \"The Godfather\" serves introductions to the Corleone family, and only with the arrival of a narcotic baron, a spark of its drama, lighted. Although Vito portrays the main character of the story, I treat it such that the Corleone family is the 'protagonist' instead, with their businesses and goals are the greatest displays of the story.My favourite moment is a scene where Michael places his sick father in a hidden room to avoid a possible assassination. And Vito's tears flow down his cheek upon discovering that his son, has performed with utmost sincerity to keep him safe. That part, clearly magnified a genuine father-son relationship and too, the sheer love that Vito has for Michael and also a magnificent clue that Michael is the right person to succeed his father as the head of the family. No matter how villainous, or powerful or influential Vito may be, he is still an ordinary father who preserves love for his children.The movie opens up relationships between the people in the family. To witness Sonny embracing his brother, Michael, before the disinclined departure, says a lot about the soft spoken allegiance he has for Michael. And also it brings to light about loyalty and protectiveness within. Not only the story painted picture of aggressiveness of the organisation, but also about characters, that men carry.James Caan, John Cazale, Robert Duvall and the rest from the cast delivers perfect performances that have made \"The Godfather\" to be inarguably one of the best acted films in history. Marlon might already have passed terrific performances for his earlier movies like \"On the Waterfront\" and \"A Streetcar Named Desire\", but his work for the \"The Godfather\" transcended all these. His embodiment of an old, fading Don gives life for excellence and the body of an acting genius. Al Pacino is responsible for the convincing but subtle transformation of Michael from an innocent war hero, to a cold, hard – hitting Don. That effortless changeover by Pacino is a marvellous piece of acting. John Marley is terrific as the outspoken movie producer but a very short screen time was given for him, and his performance is severely underrated.There is \"The Godfather\", living under the shades of cinematic greatness. The legacy and influence that the movie brings, endures till today. It is pretty much ironic that the greatest gangster movie is actually the one that romanticises the subject, not the ones that vomit the brutalities that many find a strong connection in between. Coppola made a statement that sounds like the movie is actually \"an accidental success\". I refuse to believe in that. I believe that the geniuses of Coppola, the actors, the writer and the filmmakers involved, that have had truly made \"The Godfather\" a timeless masterpiece.(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com) twitter: @Alex_DeSmall\n",

            "Review 123: Like many, I consider Citizen Kane to be the greatest film of all time. For unknown reasons, Gone With The Wind is my second favourite movie. Right behind these two is The Godfather, the mafia epic that perhaps tops more \"best of\" lists than Citizen Kane and Gone With The Wind today. As my third favourite film, I do not mind The Godfather ranking number 1 on lists and don't mind when it is raved as being \"the greatest of all time.\" It is not the best in my eyes, but I can see why it would be the best in others. Anyway, my reaction to seeing The Godfather is just like anybody else's that feel mesmerized by this mammoth piece of work.The Godfather launched the careers of director Francis Ford Coppola, author Mario Puzo, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and relaunched the career of Marlon Brando. Because of early classics like On The Waterfront and A Streetcar Named Desire, Marlon Brando earned the rep as the greatest and most influential actor in film history. With a string of less successful movies right before The Godfather, Brando's greatest rival, Sir Laurence Olivier (the greatest stage actor of the 20 century), was the original choice to play protagonist, Vito Chorleone. With Olivier still a huge movie star, Brando's performance in this epic put him back on the map and gave him an Academy Award win for best actor. Others actors, as mentioned above were also nominated for other categories, but all lost. I'm glad they lost, it was such a close call that it would have been a polar-opposing house of opinions.The Godfather tells the story of the Chorleone family: the most powerful and ruthless mafia clan in America. Don Vito Chorleone (Brando) helps out whomever he feels and makes people \"an offer they can't refuse.\" When drug dealer, Sollozzo approaches Vito asking for political protection, Vito, against drugs, declines. So Sollozzo and his current entourage of mob families attempt to kill Vito, which would make his son, Santino (Caan), the new Don as he wants to join Sollozzo. Instead, Vito survives and a deadly web of mob violence explodes. Vito's youngest son Michael (Pacino), is a war veteran who wants nothing to do with the family business, but as the violence rises and the family drastically weakens, Michael is the only one that can bring the family to their original status, by being more clever and deadlier than his father could ever be.The first half or so, to me, is more of a thriller than drama. Lots of suspense is created after Vito makes the rejection does not stop until after Michael kills Sollozzo and crooked cop, McCluskey. The second half is a drama as we see the family struggling with their downfall and soon rise. The story get more complex as the movie goes on, which may result in a confusion of who's who. That is why this movie needs your full, undivided attention and full concentration. It took me a few watches to completely understand. I love movies that require multiple viewings.The acting is the best ensemble ever put to film. Brando passes the torch to Al Pacino, as this was Brando's last monumental film and Pacino's first. I don't recall any other movie with such good acting by every single actor.4/4\n",

            "Review 124: When it comes to naming the greatest and most influential motion pictures of all time, Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 masterpiece \"The Godfather\" is a title that is practically guaranteed to be among the many listed. Famed director Stanley Kubrick called \"The Godfather\" a candidate for the best movie ever made and \"without a doubt, the best cast.\" Although not very familiar with Kubrick's films and his tastes, I will say that on the second regard, he is absolutely correct.Based on a very good, hard-to-put-down novel by Italian American novelist Mario Puzo, the film revolves around a fictional 1940s Sicilian crime family based in New York. The family is run by a wispy-voiced, puffy-cheeked man named Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who has, for the most part, moved away from the days of violence in favor of peace and prosperity without blood and above all things, lectures on the topics of friendship and loyalty. When an attempt is made on Vito's life, his two sons (James Caan, Al Pacino) and his adoptive son (Robert Duvall) take control of his dynasty and fight to keep him alive and what unfolds is a repeat of days gone by and the world of the Mafia is exposed to a spellbound, absorbed audience.\"The Godfather\" is nearly three hours in length and part of this is due to the fact that it follows Mario Puzo's novel almost exactly detail-by-detail, scene-by-scene: a very rare thing in Hollywood, which always seems more than happy to alter and reshape the mold of the authors' visions for the big screen. Coppola's film will without a doubt satisfy the purists, and even to those who have not had the privilege of reading Puzo's fantastic book, this is still a more than enjoyable way to spend three hours. Even at such a length, \"The Godfather\" never fails to keep our eyes focused on the screen.Number one, we have great characters in what is possibly the greatest cast ever assembled for a single movie. Marlon Brando was great; that was a given. But what really impressed the audiences of 1972, and what still impresses people, are the performances of the supporting cast. Names such as Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and James Caan, who are at icon status today, were nobodies at the time. Al Pacino, in particular, gives a noteworthy performance that garnered him an Academy Award nomination and made the producers who initially wanted to ban him from the role feel like the biggest idiots on the face of the planet. Pacino is undoubtedly the most ironic character in the film. When we first see him, he's not even so much as a sliver of a Mafia-type image. He's passive, he's quiet, shy, with a clean record, and a war hero. Then, when he has to assume a Family role to defend his father, he slowly turns into the image of his predecessor and by the time the film ends, Pacino is the exact opposite of how we first saw him. Of course I can't leave out Diane Keaton as Pacino's love interest, who watches him change before her eyes, James Caan as the fiery-tempered brother, Robert Duvall as the Family consiligere, and one of my favorites, Al Lettieri as the villainous, steely-eyed Virgil Sollozzo, who fits the exact image of how I pictured the character while reading the novel.Second, there is the fantastic element that the whole realm of the story takes place in the world of the Mafia. There is none of the tired old elements of, shall we say, detectives trying to uncover the Mafia and take them down or civilians who become victims of the organized crime families. With this method, we successfully connect with and understand the motivations of the characters while the outside world, law and otherwise, simply lies in the background. The outside world meant little to the Mafia, and thus it means little to us as well.But of course, \"The Godfather\" does not glorify the Mafia. Yes, we do identify and sometimes feel for the characters in this savage world, but never do we justify for them. And when director Francis Ford Coppola tries to give us horrifying violence, he delivers. As he noted in his commentary on the film, Coppola worked hard with his pyrotechnics crew to make all of the shootings and killings in \"The Godfather\" look real as opposed to making them obvious simulations. He uses blood, but not so much to the point where it becomes over the top, but just enough to make it convincing and disgusting.\"The Godfather\" was an enormous hit when it was first released. It garnered there Academy Award wins included Best Picture of the Year and broke box office records that would not be topped until \"Jaws\" (1975) was released three years later. Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall were all secured nominations in the Best Supporting Actor category but surprisingly none of them won. It also spawned two successful sequels, one of which I feel is actually superior to the original. And now Francis Ford Coppola has worked with Robert A. Harris to restore his famous trilogy and give it the pristine print that he always wanted audiences to see it in. Among other films such as \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), \"Vertigo\" (1958), and \"Spartacus\" (1960), \"The Godfather\" is certainly a film that deserves a beautiful restoration so that it may linger in our collective minds for generations to come.\n",

            "Review 125: The Godfather films (the first two at least) are operatic in their intent and are as sweeping in their view of the human condition as any American film ever made. They are not violent slice-of-life character-driven action films like Goodfellas or \"The Sopranos,\" which are a superb film and an extremely watchable cable series, respectively. The Godfather is, to my mind, superior filmmaking because of its propulsive narrative and iconic characters.What makes \"The Godfather\" great is that the characters in it know they are doing evil things, but rationalize it to themselves that \"the end justifies the means\". Coppola makes the hypocrisy and utterly failed values system pretty clear. A baptism inter-cut with scenes of murder...Vito Corleone is at his daughter's wedding, but sits there planning brutal mob stuff in his office...leave the gun take the cannoli...OK to cheat on your wife but \"dont discuss business at the table\" and so on.I had to watch this movie several times before I completely \"got\" it. The plot alone is very difficult to follow with all of the questions it raises. However it is one of those movies that rewards the viewers with those very questions for us to ponder and with its richness of story and character. The questions are about how people who regard themselves as \"good\" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. \"The Godfather\" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms? How can people who do evil things think of themselves as basically \"good\" , how can they lie to themselves as they do?Central to all of this is the metamorphosis of Michael Corleone. He starts out as the returned all American WWII soldier with the respectable but outsider (in reference to \"The Family\") girlfriend, Kay, and by just doing what he thinks he must do to protect his family, one thing leads to another, and he ends up the cynical head of the Corleone crime family, morally miles from where he was when we first meet him.\n",

            "Review 126: Francis Ford Coppolas' rich, vivid portrait of Italian-American mob families, drawn from the novel by Mario Puzo, remains a true high water mark for cinema, approximately half a century later. While it's rather a shame that it took this viewer this long to get around to watching it, he can say that he is now glad he did. Populated with a diverse array of interesting characters, iconic lines and scenes, and some VERY effective moments of extreme violence, it makes its impact in a major way.Buried under amazing Dick Smith makeup, an impressive, Oscar-winning Marlon Brando takes center stage as Don Vito Corleone, a calm & controlled mafia boss running his business professionally. His youngest son is Michael (a fantastic Al Pacino), a war veteran with no initial thought of entering the family business, but who adapts to it better than he ever thought possible.What's indicative of how powerful \"The Godfather\" remains is the way that it holds viewer attention, even through a seemingly unwieldy running time of just under three hours. It's compelling through and through, with a matter of fact approach to the machinations of the mafia, and not much time for melodrama (although there are certainly some histrionics in later scenes). Granted, it's not quite as interesting in its second half, when Michael has committed a double killing and goes into temporary hiding in Sicily. But it picks up steam again for a superb finale when Michael and his associates methodically go about eliminating their enemies.The cast is just STACKED with top-notch actors: James Caan, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, Richard Conte, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, Joe Spinell (in his uncredited film debut), etc. Caan gives a forceful performance as the hot-headed Sonny, while the young Pacino does wonderful, subtle work, many years before he would adopt some of his less effective acting traits.Nicely scored by Nino Rota (that main theme is definitely haunting) and strikingly photographed by Gordon Willis, this continues to be one of the highlights of Coppolas' career, although he would follow it up with films that were no less worthy; his run through the 70s is pretty unbeatable.Followed by two sequels, \"The Godfather\" cemented its place as one of the most definitive mob movies of all time.Scripted by Puzo and Coppola.10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 127: Coppola's crime saga is sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope, focusing as much on family dynamics as mafia machinations, and is all the more impactful for it. 'The Godfather (1972)' honestly feels epic, despite the fact that its relatively few key events are all quite contained (considering it spans nearly three-hours.) This effect is hard to put your finger on but certainly tangible, especially in retrospect; it really feels as though you've witnessed a journey, the beginning of an empire or at least a transitioning period within it, in a way which few films have achieved. It's actually a fair while before we learn anything out-rightly illegitimate is actually transpiring, though, and even then its all treated so casually that it really does feel just like the family business. That's a real strength of the picture, too: how little it relies on needless exposition to convey its characters or world. It is refreshing to get a truly inside perspective on sometimes unseemly events without ever being bombarded with morality, but instead trusted to make up our own minds about several situations that are shaded in grey. While the piece is a little long and can sometimes meander, several explosive sequences and character-driven moments add up, in equal measure, to an excellent experience overall that has defined the gangster genre. It is regarded a classic for good reason. 9/10\n",

Aging Don Vito Corleone must pick a successor, but a violent war among a rival family, and betrayal from within, threaten to shatter this close-knit family.Long, but not over-long, this moves at a fantastic pace, and is among the most engrossing films ever made, many memorable scenes and lines.A masterpiece.\n",

But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10.\n",

The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see.\n",

            "Review 134: What happened to the sure-footed director of this film?  How did his impeccable craftsmanship ever give rise to such things as the slipshod, overwrought \"Dracula\"?SPOILERS FOLLOWIt's hard to say, but there IS that moment near the end, which some mistake for a climax or even a turning point:  Michael is in church, at the Christening ceremony of his sister's child; his henchmen are in various positions around the city (one in Nevada), poised to murder the Corleone family's most powerful enemies and rivals.  Coppola introduces a device he had hitherto studiously avoided: fast cross cutting.  \"Do you, Michael Corleone, renounce Satan?\" asks a priest.  Cut to some act of violence.  Cut back to Michael: \"I do.\"  Cut to violence.  \"And all his works?\"  Cut: Blam! Michael: \"I do.\"  Cut: another  stylishly staged shooting.  It's a wonder Francis Ford Coppola doesn't write the words \"Please note the irony\" across the screen.I don't fault the decision to use rapid, gliding montage at this point, given that it ISN'T a key moment, merely one that plays out decisions we had seen made earlier, but there's no denying that in the way it's done Coppola both hits us over the head and goes over the top (some of the killings are too operatic for what is essentially a stealth operation) - although thankfully, less far over the top than he probably planned, since the gravitational pull of his carefully made world remains strong.I must stress that this excess doesn't matter HERE.  I mention it because it's perhaps the seed of something that would grow and grow and ultimately choke later Coppola films.  Just a thought.  \"The Godfather\" itself is perfectly crafted and shaded.  There's the well realised and well photographed settings, both 1940s New York and timeless Sicily; there's the believability and depth (when The Don is shot and thought to be dead, the tears look unforced and REAL, which I doubt you could say of those in any other gangster film); there's the sense that we know these people, culturally homogenous yet not at all the same.  There's Nino Rota's wonderful score.  I don't think this is a GREAT film, in the sense that so many other people seem to think it is.  It doesn't matter.Interestingly, the morning of the day I saw \"The Godfather\" (I'd seen it before, but this was the first actual screening), someone wrote to me to protest that my harsh comments on Marlon Brando based on his performance in another film (\"Viva Zapata!\") were unfair.  What I'd said had struck me as obvious: that Brando's introspective style reveals his character far more to him than it does to us; that he acts without INTERacting, failing to mesh with the rest of the cast; that he mumbles too much.  In my reply I had to admit that I hadn't seen many Brando performances, and of the earlier ones, only Zapata.  I was almost going to admit that his performance in \"The Godfather\" was faultless.  A good thing I didn't!  When I saw it again I realised that Brando may have sufficient grip on his character not to let the film down, but just barely; again, he introspects too much, interacts too little, and mumbles.Yet the acting in \"The Godfather\" and the film overall are too strong for this to matter in the least.\n",

            "Review 135: ...\"The Godfather\", as everyone knows, is a classic.  It follows the Corleone family over a period of a few years in the forties.  It starts with godfather Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and ends with godfather - and Vito's son - Michael Corleone (Al Pacino).  Also involved are Sonny Corleone (James Caan), adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and muscle Peter Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) to name a few.The acting ensemble is one of the greatest put together in film history. Brando plays the wise Vito Corleone very well, but the best performances come from Pacino as Michael and Caan as Sonny.  Pacino is probably the greatest character actor of all time, and this film shows it.  He plays Michael at the start with a young naivety and is able to bring the character along to the end of the film, where he shows the growth of Michael's knowledge and wisdom.  Unfortunately, Caan is only in about half the movie, but he certainly does an incredible job as the hot tempered Sonny.\"The Godfather\" is the template for good drama.  Few films achieve it's greatness, but in the end, it is surely not the best.  In my opinion, there is no best movie of all time, but many 'best' films per genre.  \"The Godfather\" is the best crime drama.  \"Casablanca\" is the best romance.  \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" movies are the best adventures.  All of said movies would tie, and be equal in greatness.So, if you're ever tired of these days' mindless action and mediocre drama films, then pop in one of the classics.  Any one will do, they are all equally entertaining.  Films like \"The Godfather\", \"Casablanca\", \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" are the reason movies are so popular.Enjoy, 9/10.\n",

All of those elements make The Godfather a flawless film that is cinema and Francis Ford Coppola at their best.Based on Mario Puzo's novel and set in New York City in the 1940s and 50s,The Godfather tells the story of Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando),a Don and Mob Boss who is the head of The Corleone Family but is aging. But when Vito becomes a victim of Mob warfare,his youngest son Michael Corleone(Al Pacino)steps in to take over the family as the new don and to protect his Father and family at all costs.What else can be said about The Godfather that hasn't been said before? It's an absolute masterpiece of cinema that is an instant classic from the moment you first watch it. There are plenty of iconic and memorable characters,lines and moments throughout the film that have become apart of our pop culture that when you the name The Godfather everyone knows what the film is even if people haven't seen it. The Godfather is a very revolutionary film especially with the Gangster/Mob genre because before The Godfather Gangster and Mob films used to be defined by the great Warner Bros Gangster Crime Dramas that starred movie icons James Cagney,Edward G. Robinson and Humphrey Bogart but The Godfather reinvented the Gangster/Mob genre and has a style that has been imitated but not duplicated. Where would Martin Scorsese's classic Gangster epics Goodfellas and Casino or the classic TV series The Sopranos be without The Godfather? The Godfather is a big,epic film that gives viewers a larger than life depiction of a organized Crime family showing the danger,tragedy and sadness that goes on in the violent world that the Corleone's have to deal with throughout the film. Some have said that The Godfather and it's sequels romanticizes the Gangster and Mafia lifestyle and made the mafia world bright and while that may or may not be true,The Godfather is still surrounded with darkness showing the horrifying and deadly consequences of being in the Gangster world where no one is safe. The film is an epic in the truest sense of the world with the length being 175 minutes(2 hrs and 55 minutes)and with The Godfather being an epic there is multiple characters and story lines but director Francis Coppola keeps the film interesting and keeps you glued to the screen with many powerful,intense scenes that punch the viewer in the gut. The screenplay by Francis Coppola and Mario Puzo is amazing and flawless with many scenes and dialog that is riveting and powerful and none of the dialog and scenes feel forced or fake but feel natural and believable. The screenplay while taking out some of the subplots of the book stays true to Mario Puzo's book with dialog that comes directly from the book. The Godfather's script is movie screen writing at it's very best The Godfather gave birth to two of the greatest and most iconic characters in movie history in Vito Corleone and Michael Corleone. When we see Vito in the first we are easily captivated by him and how he is because despite being a don and major crime figure he can be friendly and helpful with his family and friends earning tons of respect. Vito is also smart and has a moral code when it comes with his family while at the same time using violence against his enemies when needed. With Michael we see how different he becomes throughout the film because at first he wants nothing to do with the family business but when his Father and family are in danger in Michael's mind he has no choice but to run the family but in his own way. Where as Vito is a friendly and helpful don,Michael is cold and vicious but with these two characters there is many levels of depth that make them classic characters you will never forget. Violence plays a big part in The Godfather and the violence in this film shocking with scenes that are brutal and harsh but are true to the universe that The Godfather takes place in. The ending of The Godfather is easily one of the best endings in movie history and greatly sets up the events in Part II. A terrific ending.The cast is flawless. Marlon Brando is excellent,iconic and at his very best in his Oscar winning role as Vito Corleone,with Brando being charismatic,powerful and sympathetic in the role. Masterful performance from Brando. Al Pacino is brilliant as Michael Corleone,with Pacino being intense,cool and captivating in the role and having great scenes with Brando. James Caan is amazing and fiery as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone,Michael's short tempered older brother. Roberl DuVall is terrific as Tom Hagan,the Corleone's adopted family member and lawyer. Diane Keaton is great as Kay Adams,Michael's girlfriend. Richard Castellano(Clemenza)and Abe Vigoda(Tessio)do wonderful jobs as Vito's Caporegimes. John Gazale(Fredo Corleone),Talia Shire(Connie Corleone),Al Lettieri(Sollozzo),Sterling Hayden(Capt. McCluskey),John Marley(Jack Woltz),Richard Conte(Don Barzini),Alex Rocco(Moe Greeneand Gianni Russo(Carlo)give riveting performances as well.The direction by Francis Coppola is brilliant and stylish,with Coppola always moving the camera and using great lighting and a visual look to the movie that makes The Godfather what it is. Masterful direction,Coppola.The score by Nino Rota is amazing,beautiful,haunting and iconic matching the movie and every scene perfectly. Terrific score Rota.In final word,if you love Francis Coppola,Gangster Films,Mob Movies,Crime Dramas or cinema in general,I highly suggest you see The Godfather,an excellent and unforgettable masterpiece that you will watch again,again and again and is film making at it's best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.\n",

            "Review 138: My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠'The Godfather' is a masterpiece, a perfect gangster movie. A film without flaws, blunders and cliches, which pulls me to writing a review and it feels like I know it completely by heart having seen it a million times now. This is a classic, a gangster epic and a bible for cinephiles. A worthy picture, without exaggeration, the best of it's kind.Adapted from Mario Puzo's best-selling Mafia saga, 'The Godfather' is a serious dramatic masterpiece directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It is genuinely a top-notch film which depicts the blood, sweat and drama of the Corleone Mafia family.The film is a long (running time of 2 hours 55 minutes) and leisurely apotheosis of the Corleone family which marvellously builds up a rich pattern of relationships, meticulously detailing the rituals of an enclosed group. The tone of the film is laudatory and romantic and the extraordinary chiaroscuro of the cinematography completely steals my heart.'The Godfather' contains famous unforgettable scenes such as the opening wedding celebration, a severed horse's head left in an enemy's bed and the cold-blooded killing happening simultaneously with a baby's baptism. However, my favourite scene in the movie is the one wherein Michael Corleone's new bride dies in a car bomb-blast.Coppola not only superbly created the film, but brilliantly chose his actors. Who knows what the fate of the film would have been without Marlon Brando and Al Pacino. Marlon Brando is outstanding. His cotton-stuffed cheeks and an almost inaudible whisper perfectly define the style of a reigning Head of Mafia. His presence brings energy to the screen. This was definitely Brando's best ever performance which won him an Oscar which he infamously refused. Yes, the man who made offers others couldn't refuse once refused the movie industry's heftiest honour. Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is no less interesting than his father. Michael is kind-hearted and truthful, knowing what his father does, he never wanted to deal in his family's business and participate in criminal quarrels. Al Pacino played his character no less brilliantly than Marlon Brando. Pacino showed the destruction and the transformation of his character: from the uninitiated in the affairs of the family being the young war hero, to the new Don of the Corleone family, possessing an iron will, foresight, wisdom and dignity.For all its cold-bloodedness, the film is most powerful in conveying the codes of loyalty, love, masculine honour and feminine subservience, enterprise and corporate self-interests in a crime-ridden America. In addition to the brilliant acting and excellent production of the film, there is the wonderful music score of the composer Nino Rota. An excellent melody which has long become a classic. 10/10 for me.\n",

            "Review 139: There isn't a gangster film out there bigger or better than The Godfather. It's hard to some it up in a few words, but here goes. At the centre of this film is the family. The Corleone family, headed by Vito (Marlon Brando), a.k.a. The Don, or The Godfather. His daughter's wedding tells us all we need to know about the Corleone's; key individuals, small but incredibly thought out sub-plots and a running theme of business and personal matters never mix. The Godfather is based on the simplest of foundations. Love thy family. Think before you act. Never betray your own. Vito attempts to keep the peace between the crime families. When things go south Vito's youngest son Michael (Al Pacino) gets involved. Michael's innocence is torn apart as he takes control of the family business.With every view comes a new discovery, a piece of the puzzle missed the last time round. The Godfather is a labyrinth waiting to be deciphered. Brando is sublime. He's able to radiate warmth and coercion with the smallest of reactions. It sets up careers for James Caan and Robert Duvall, who're brothers with dissimilar attitudes. The best is to come for Pacino, as this first part in a trilogy only shows his potential. The Godfather is a one of the most intense gangsters films you're ever likely to see.\n",

            "Review 141: STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs The epic tale of Don Vito (Marlon Brando) head and patriarch of the Corleone crime family.When a rival family tries to muscle in on their patch,they offer the usual resistance.But when the Don is brutally gunned down in the street,a vicious attempt on his life,it falls to his sons,Michael (Al Pacino),the youngest,a Vietnam vet just returned home from active service,Fredo (John Cazele) the more reserved,prone-to-mistakes brother and Scillio (James Caan) his hot-headed,violent son,to settle the score both amicably and with mettle.It's funny that just six days ago I was reviewing a film that ranked #18 on the bottom 100 list and yet today I'm reviewing a film that ranks right up at #1 on the top 250.Yet,indeed,this is truly an epic film that everyone who would like to call themselves a film connoisseur owes it to themselves to see.Brando sadly passed away last year.If not for his extroverted private life,he will undoubtedly be best remembered for his leading role here,despite the staggeringly short amount of screen-time he actually occupies.Pacino too really launched his career here,and it's amazing to look back and see how young and fresh-faced he looked.In supporting roles,the film also undoubtedly helped make big names out of Caan and Robert Duvall as the family lawyer.Even the director,Francis Ford Coppola,probably never made anything that matched this (especially if you consider the chunks of cr*p he was shooting out later in his career.) What I found most notable about the film is actually the sweeping,powerful score that plays over all the scenes with a majesty that is truly compelling and will stick in your mind for a while after you've seen it.But more than that,it is a film that is truly rich and flowing with texture and depth,that manages to flow with the vitality of the characters.I have a short attention span,like a lot of people of the MTV generation,so it's a film you might find hard to settle down and watch without fidgeting around a lot.But anyone who sees it would be unable to deny that it is,well,really what film-making is all about,truly masterful,fulfilled,dynamic stuff that puts a lot of the rubbish that gets spewed out today to shame.*****\n",

The casting is superb, the character development is superb, the acting is first class, coupled with the legendary soundtrack a true masterpiece.From the script to the whole dialogue and interactions between the characters the attention to detail is stunning and I wish more modern movie makers would take the time to build and develop the characters like this movie does.From the opening scene, when Bonasera is looking for revenge for the beating of his daughter, to the closing scene when Kay sees Michael crowned as the Don and Neri closes the door, the movie just flows seamlessly from act to act. Coupled with the legendary soundtrackThe scene where Sonny, Michael, Tessio, Hagen and Clemenza are discussing hitting Solozzo is pure gold. As they all sit around nonchalantly discussing murder, before Michael pipes up and tells them how if they arrange a meeting he will kill them both is so just so well acted, that you actually believe these guys are gangsters.A real example of great story telling transferred to film.\n",

            "Review 146: As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10\n",

            "Review 147: The story of a Mafia family it's about honor and loyalty but it's also a story of crime, it both espouses and perverts the American dream. The film has so many iconic scenes that stand out in the memory, even when years pass between viewings. The film was based upon the best selling novel by Mario Puzo.The film has an amazing cast who bring to life memorable and well rounded characters to earn our sympathy, despite some of the deeds they perpetrate. While Marlon Brando would receive the accolades and the Academy Award, we also have Oscar nominated performances from James Caan, Robert Duvall and Al Pacino. Also of note is John Cazale (he appeared in only 6 films before his untimely death, all of them were nominated for Best Picture). Not to be forgotten are; Sterling Hayden, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda and Talia Shire. The cast between them have thus far won 5 Oscars wins and been nominated for another 22.We have the incredible score of Nino Rota remains one of the most evocative scores in film, and it is a tribute to the composer and the film that just a few notes can conjure such images almost 50 years later.We also have the wonderful cinematography of Gordon Willis who created such powerful images, at times very warm while at other times so very dark.There's no doubt that the film does paint a somewhat romanticized portrait of a mafia family but it's not just a film about crime it's about family. The film was followed up shortly by a very good sequel (Godfather II) that maintained the high standards of its predecessor even to the extent of achieving the Academy Award for Best Picture, but for me it wasn't quite as compelling. These films were followed by a less memorable sequel (Godfather III) 16 years later that while earning 7 Oscar nominations itself, mostly served as a reminder of how much less powerful it was than its predecessors.\n",

I have seen it many times and recently purchased the movie so that I could watch it anytime that I want. I love the score for this film and get goosebumps when I hear that opening trumpet begin to play. As the movie progresses I begin to feel a connection to the characters and become invested in their growth and story. As many times as I have seen this movie, I continue to have the same feelings. It is one of the movies that can never get old and will always be a masterpiece.

Marlon Brando's perfect portrayal of Mafia boss Don Vito Corleone is simply unforgettable and one of the finest performances everFrancis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's superb novel in a breathtaking fashion.Upon its release in 1972, many people knew that something special was expected - the result, one of, if not the greatest and superior film of all time. I won't sit here defending this colossal masterpiece, it needs no such thing. The Godfather is the definitive inside to the operations, bonds and thoughts of the Mafia. Only one other film manages to give us a breathtaking panorama of the Mafia and that is Martin Scorsese's 'Goodfellas'. Every gangster film is measured alogn the breadth of The Godfather:'The best gangster film since The Godfather'Coppola has created something so powerful, so unique that essentially cemented a whole new genre of film-making. This film did not follow stereotypes, arguably it created them. Breathtaking direction, incomparable acting, one of the best screenplays in the history of film amount to one of the most memorable achievements in film history.-10/10-\n",

            "Review 152: So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is \"Apocalypse, Now\". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one.\n",

            "Review 153: Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills.\n",

            "Review 154: My father would watch this on vhs, recorded off cable, often. He was born in the 30s, grew up during the depression and world war 2. This film depicts an America that he lived through and with authenticity. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece here. Attention to every detail pays off. A master class in storytelling. Think of Enzo the baker. A minor scene in the very beginning regarding Enzo is actually an introduction to an important element at the scene at the hospital. Enzo shows up to bring flowers and Michael uses him to help ward off assassins, which leads to McCluskey assaulting Michael and in turn leads to.... Well, you know. A film as well written, well acted, well filmed, paced etc. As The Godfather is as rare as anything. Hyperbole aside, this is a true twentieth century American masterpiece in film making. Every film that came after it owes a debt of gratitude. Deserving of all the praise that had been bestowed upon it.\n",

As Michael is courting Apollonia, he takes her for a walk, the camera remains behind the couple and we are not privy to their conversation as they walk onward, followed by a formative collection of sisters, cousins and perhaps even Apollonia's mother. In contrast, when Michael is courting Kay, back from his long time away, he walks with her, much like he walked with Apollonia, but now the camera is in front of the couple, and we are privy to their conversation. They too have an escort following them at a discreet distance, but now it is a black car with muscle/protection.\n",

            "Review 157: Francis Ford Coppola, maybe, didn't think in 1972 that this film would have become a cinematic icon. It's like a show business fairy tale: the young director needed a hit, he had debts and Paramount commissioned him to direct a movie based on Mario Puzo's bestseller. Coppola hired a big forgotten star -Marlon Brando- and some young and relatively unknown actors -Pacino, Caan, Duvall and Diane Keaton. Federico Fellini's music composer (Nino Rota) wrote the soundtrack. The film was shot in Sicily, New York and California. The rest is history.\"The Godfather\" is a novel about an Italian-American family and the relationships in the Mafia. It's not only a blockbuster, it is also a deep study of characters. Coppola says that \"Godfather\" is a metaphorical vision of power in America... We can see this especially in \"Part Two\", which is not just a sequel: it's another chapter, where Coppola shows more contradictions in US society -Mafia's reign talks more and more with the other social and political institutions. (Martin Scorsese, for his Mafia's movies, chooses a more neurotic way of telling stories, whereas Coppola prefer a more classical style for his tales and likes to novelize the events.).\"The Godfather\" (1972): we know the Corleone's family and the way a clan keeps its power. There are rhythm, action, drama. And strong acting performances.\"The Godfather, Part Two\" (1974): the story goes on. A more bitter trip into the power and the loneliness of a Boss. The highlight is the combination of two parallel stories -Robert De Niro is the young Vito Corleone, and Al Pacino is the established \"Don\" Michael in the Sixties. It's the best sequel ever realized, maybe better than the original film.\"The Godfather, Part Three\" (1990): not as good as the two previous -actually it is much inferior to them, it was made too many years later. Some allusions to Italian mysteries (the death of businessman Roberto Calvi, the P2 lodge) are quite superficial. For the rest, the movie is well directed. Pacino is more Shakespearean -Coppola says like King Lear...A must for the new Hollywood movies lovers. The first two chapters in particular.\n",

            "Review 158: I was searching through the reviews of this film and came across a couple that weren't particularly complimentary about the film. Firstly I have to say that this film is not my favourite film of all time, but is definitely in my top 3. Secondly, one person seemed to take offence of Marlon Brando's performance, that in itself is an insult as Brando was incredible in this film. Coppola's direction and attention to detail are inch perfect for me. The whole cast was brilliant in particular Al Pacino who gives an Oscar worthy performance of epic proportions. You don't just watch this film for me, you experience a whole new chapter of life that most would never experience through this film. The word epic can be overused in terms of film but this is 100% an epic of epic proportions. I agree that everyone is entitled to an opinion but get with it man, you don't get films better than this and I refuse to believe that people who have rated the likes of 'Django unchained' as close in terms of quality to this film should be allowed to comment on film in general. 10/10!!!\n",

            "Review 159: The beginning of a movie always sets the tone. Same goes for this movie here. And watching this you can understand how this influenced the TV show \"Sopranos\". But back to the first scene. It involves the Godfather character who has to talk to people on the wedding day of his daughter, because it is tradition. The way it is filmed and lit is exceptional. The tone is set in more than one settings. Because you also get what the movie is about: Respect, Fear and Power.Some of which get achieved by manipulation, convincing (in more than one way) or buy-out. What lies above all? A thing the Godfather always tells his children (or his lawyer)? Family is what matters. The movie does hold up to the test of times. You might have seen movies that have more violence in them, but when this movie gets violent it doesn't hold back.The performances are awesome and I can't wait to listen to the audio commentary by Mr. Coppola (which is supposed to be controversial, I'll see about that). So re-watching the movie reminded me of how good it is. But also of how much I miss the Sopranos. One of most known little facts of the movie, Marlon Brando stuffing his cheeks, make you look at the movie differently too. It still takes nothing away from it of course. Exceptional in every sense, even if you don't agree with the way the \"family\" functions (and you shouldn't agree with it of course, just saying)\n",

            "Review 160: Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the \"Gone with the Wind\" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend.\n",

            "Review 161: Let's talk about what many people call the greatest movie of all time: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. Released in 1972, it took the world by storm, becoming the highest-grossing movie of all time and ushering in a new era of film. Centering around a New York mob family and the descent into darkness of young Michael Corleone, played famously and fantastically by Al Pacino, it took us fully out of the Hays Code era and showed what film could do with mature subject matter.It is also wonderfully acted, stunningly scored, scorchingly directed, and thrillingly cinematographed. When someone says 'The Godfather', a detailed series of images pop into my mind, a series of images distinct from every other film series in the world. It could copyright its aesthetic, an aesthetic that fits its tone and mood like climatic battles fit action movies or long kisses fit romance movies or sunsets fit the island of Santorini.This film won five Academy Awards. I can safely that is too low. There is nothing in these films that is any less than the finest filmmaking ever produced. It is the work of a group of men and women at the height of their prowess. Pacino has starred in some terrible movies over the last twenty-five years, including the one that one him an Oscar. And Coppola? The best thing he did after the 70's were adaptations of teen novels. Now, doesn't that seem backwards to you? You're supposed to start off making adaptations of teen novels and move on to 'serious', 'adult' fare afterwards.But none of that matters, not really. You don't remember Audrey Hepburn as an old woman dying of caner in the 90's. You think of her as one of the influential symbols of the 50's and 60's. And so it is here. Coppola could have jumped off a bridge in 1980, leaving little Sofia without a father. That would have a terrible tragedy, but for better or for worse, it would not be the first thing people remember about him. People die. Art survives. Good art grows. And this is certainly good art.The next time I watch this movie, I should do a full analysis. It'd take a day or so, and it'd probably run over 30 pages, but I think it's be worth it. There are so many themes at play here. There is enough symbolism floating around to drive someone bad. As a general rule of thumb, if it looks symbolic, it probably is.There are so many memorable quotes from this movie. I hope you guys don't mind me closing out this review by posting a slew of them.\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse.\" \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\" \"It's a Sicilian message. It means Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes.\" \"In Sicily, women are more dangerous than shotguns.\" \"I believe in America.\" ...Okay, I'm not seriously gonna stop the review. But you get my point. And none of these quotes come at the expense of telling a great story. Many scripts pick between being watertight and being evocative. This one is both, and because of that, all these lines stick in the audience's mind.One of the greatest lies of cinema is that the lines people remember are the best lines in any given film. If that were true, we'd have stoned college kids and vapid teenage blondes quoting long, flowery speeches instead of catchphrases. People remember lines in films because 1) the lines are important to the plot, 2) the lines are not something that would normally be spoken, and 3) the lines are delivered well.The people who make animated kids' films have a tendency to forget steps 1 and 3.Throughout the history of filmmaking, there has never been a film both as good and as iconic as The Godfather. When people talk about films, it is one of the first to come to mind.In my opinion, it is the face of American filmmaking. Of all the films I have watched, none have more accurately portrayed what it is to be American. Yes, this a film about crime and the mafia. But it is also a film about identity and opportunity and progress and transition and cutthroat business and hope and fear and assimilation and betrayal and broken dreams and uncertainty and family and traditionalism and modernism and ascending and descending.Annie Hall and especially Manhattan are love letters to NYC. This is a love letter to America. But it is also a hate letter. It explores both sides of the American Dream. It explores the highs and lows and temptations and opportunity everyone faces as they try to make it in this country. It is explores this glorious mess of a land.Not much else I can say. If you haven't yet seen it, see it.\n",

It was a decent movie, of course; but, in the end, it had a few major flaws.First and foremost is a flaw that many may see as a great asset (thus pointing out the obviously subjective nature of movie watching): its length. Now, I have nothing against long movies, but this one just seemed to drag on and on and on. I've seen many people who made this complaint get called people with low attention spans and low intelligence; this is complete idiocy. The movie had, for all its apparent greatness, many superfluous scenes (the parts of the movie that took place in Sicily seemed particularly long and drawn out). It truly did not know when to end, and thus did not keep my interest.Another flaw was the the pompousness of the film. It truly seemed to me that every person involved was completely full of themselves and the movie they were making. It just bugged the crud out of me.Another flaw was the underdevelopment of many of the other crime bosses in the film, all of which are of course killed by Michael's men. I didn't even know any of their names, and this alone should show you how little I could care about them. A great movie makes you care about even the villains, so that their deaths are affecting.There's more I could say, but I have limited space here, so I'll just sum it up by saying that it was decent, but far from the greatest movie ever made. In fact, it is probably the most highly overrated movie of all time.\n",

The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema.

            "Review 169: I finally got a chance to see this movie. I tried to watch it with an open mind, without letting the hype dilute an even slight bit of impartiality - and I just can't say it's a very good movie. Perchance if soap opera was its own category, this may stand true to its title as \"#1\" on the IMDb.   It perplexes me how people can call this landmark moviemaking when they probably have not seen works from other directors - Kurosawa, Truffaut, Lang... - all of whom had a much better eye than Coppolla. Most of these greats are now forgotten, with the exceptions of occasional screenings at film schools where one discovers that the Contemporary filmmaking style overseas  (1950s and 1960s)  was duplicated by American directors in the 1970s.  So what was wrong with this movie? Nonexistent or loose plot: No suspense, climax, excitement, or outcome. I thought the acting/characters were forgettable. Any other actor could have pulled off what Brando did and the fact they went through all that trouble to make him 10 or 20 year older just proves they shot for name recognition.  There were only a few things that I remember in this 3 hours of triviality: the \"offer you can't refuse\" line, Don Vito collapsing in a garden while a child obliviously plays, Caan's Santino character getting holed up, and bullets consistently going into foreheads. Maybe the artful yet repellent depiction of gratuitous violence is what made this such a masterpiece. But style without substance does not a good movie make. For those who say \"oh, you just didn't get it, see it again\", please get your mind out of the gutter - stop basing your opinions on what you're conditioned to like. The Emperor's New Clothes, big time. End of review.\n",

            "Review 170: I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, \"Is it The Godfather level good or not ?\".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion. All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of \"Bravo!\". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie.\n",

            "Review 173: Of all the movies I love and admire, I just have to say The Godfather is my favourite movie ever. I could go on forever talking about how great it is. It's beautiful to watch from the opening monologue to the closing-door ending. I know it's kind of cliché to call The Godfather your favourite movie but I mean how could you not? It's pretty much perfect in every way: perfect acting, perfect directing, perfect writing, perfect pacing, perfect music, perfect cinematography etc. Not to mention it has one of the greatest actors of all time, Marlon Brando in one of the most iconic performances of all time and it helped restore his career. And it made actors like the great Al Pacino a superstar. In fact, The Godfather changed everything in terms of movie-making. Anyone who loves movies, should definitely see The Godfather. It's too bad Marlon Brando wasn't present at the Oscars in 1973 because it would've been amazing to see him give on speech on winning the award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for a second time and thanking everyone involved with The Godfather.But even I'm surprised to call The Godfather my favourite movie ever because I'm not mad on gangster movies. Like I think Goodfellas is really overrated and I think Scarface with Al Pacino is nothing special. But I also think The Godfather: Part II is a masterpiece as well even though it's not as good as the original and it doesn't feel the same without Marlon Brando. Though I've never watched The Godfather: Part III but it's considered by many to be very disappointing so I choose to stay away from it. But in conclusion, to put it rather bluntly, if you don't like The Godfather, it's hard to believe you like movies.\n",

This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called \"classics\" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive.\n",

I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for \"Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that \"Cabaret\" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, \"The Godfather\" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous.\n",

            "Review 180: Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: \"Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car\" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output.\n",

            "Review 181: Since I was a small boy, whenever I heard of others talking of the greatest movies ever made, The Godfather always came up,most of the time, at the top. I always thought that the movie was overrated, that is, until watched it two years ago.How to tell if a movie is good? If you can't stop thinking about it, if you keep replaying the characters' lines in your sleep, then the movie isn't just good, it's great. The Godfather's impact on the movie industry is incalculable, in almost ever modern gangster movie there is at least one reference to it.I can find no flaw in this movie. If there were anything such as a 'perfect' movie, this is it. Coppola provides excellent direction such that though the movie stretches to almost three hours, you won't be bored for one minute. The highlight of this film is an innovation. The gangsters here are not portrayed as mindless monsters but as men with families. We see Vito and Michael Corleone as protagonists rather than antagonists. Credit for this goes to Mario Puzo's original source material but let us not forget the actors.Marlon Brando gives the greatest performance of not only his career but of any other actor as the family patriarch. He's so Don-like that you just wished you could go to him with all your problems too. Al Pacino plays Michael Corleone. But he doesn't give a single performance, he gives two. At the beginning, he plays a war hero who doesn't want anything to do with the family business. Pacino skillfully shows us Michael's transition from this to a cold blooded Don at the end. The other actors play their parts well too. In fact, there has never been any other better cast than the cast of The Godfather.A cinematic masterpiece, this is one for the ages.\n",

I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty.

This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out. Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks and he sees no other ways than to step in and fight for his family; if you watched Scarface and you liked Tony Montana, than you'd like Michael as well.

I must say this is the most inexplicably overrated piece of trash I've ever seen. The characters are all ridiculous, unsympathetic and under developed, the story drags and lacks any real conflict and dynamics But the most disgusting aspect is the movie's intent to glorify a bunch of low-life criminals and turn them into larger-than-life figures, into some kind of royalty. This whole \"family\" tradition is just ludicrous. We're supposed to \"care\" about these characters, to think that they are \"cool\". The major problem here is that there's no real conflict. There's no redeeming value whatsoever, they're all despicable and one-dimensional, so why the hell would I care. The violence (which is particularly sickening) is another issue, but I guess audiences have come to appreciate it, and it's now a \"hallmark\" of the genre. Imagine, the Godfather's pregnant daughter gets beaten with a belt. But guess what: she's not likable either! She's hysterical, obnoxious and, even worse, she keeps defending her abusive husband. In another scene, James Caan beats the hell out of someone in front of children. Marvelous! That's just great, not to mention cool and \"culturally relevant\". Marlon Brando speaking with a husky voice and cotton in his mouth is incredibly ridiculous. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone suddenly turns, from a principled man who doesn't want to have anything to do with murder, into a ruthless criminal. What? This character has no depth, no consistency whatsoever. His relationships with women are so poorly portrayed, they add nothing to his development. It's Pacino's worst, I can't imagine why anyone would think this is a great performance. If you want to see a good gangster movie, go watch \"Donnie Brasco\" instead.\n",

            "Review 201: I finally watched this movie, and I just don't get the hype. I didn't dislike it, and the violence didn't bother me, but I found it over-long and very, very slow. I'm a 50-something who doesn't demand a break-neck pace in a film, even an \"action\" film I'm used to watching long movies that take some time to unfold, and I don't mind that. I have patience. But \"The Godfather\" just seemed to be moving at the wrong pace for its subject matter. I never got into it. I finished it, but I didn't feel drawn into their world.Not helping was the fact that of course by now everyone, even those who haven't seen the film, knows about all the catch-phrases and classic scenes, so they seem like jokes (although naturally that wouldn't have been a problem when the film was newly-released). Brando almost seemed to be a caricature of himself in the early scenes although he got a little better, a little less heavy-handed, after the Don came home from the hospital. In that first sequence in his office during the wedding, I could hardly understand a word he was saying. How could anyone take a man who spoke that way seriously? But again, I was watching it after many years of encountering deliberately bad Brando imitations, so I was at a disadvantage in that respect.That wedding good lord, it lasted longer than many marriages do! I thought it was never going to be over. But while I was watching it, I recalled that I had in fact tried to watch this movie about 30 years ago, when my brother was really into it. I didn't even make it through the wedding. I remember my brother fast-forwarding the VHS tape to show me Abe Vigoda when he became convinced I wasn't going to sit and watch the whole thing with him one quick look at Abe Vigoda and I was outta there. This time I also noticed one of my favorite character actors, Vito Scotti, in the wedding sequence.The people who did \"General Hospital\" in the 1990's must have loved this film. They even lifted the mobster's-chick-gets-blown-up-in-car idea for recycling on the soap opera.I watched the DVD over two nights. The local public library gives me 7, and for a while there I thought I was gonna need 'em all. A good illustration of my feelings for the tension and pacing of the film are that after Sonny bought it at the tollbooth, I turned it off for the night and went to bed, since that was as good a place as any to break. Just didn't care, one way or the other, what was going to happen next. One less character to keep track of. Plenty more where he came from. I was just hoping Vito Scotti would come back.I won't give it a 1 as others have in a deliberate attempt to bring down its average I'll give it an honest rating that I really feel it deserves. The fact that I don't understand why so many people are so crazy about this film doesn't necessarily mean that I'm right and they're wrong in fact, it might well be the opposite. But I stand by the title of this review: I just don't get it.\n",

This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones.\n",

The cinematagraphy was fantastic and the dialogue was iconic, but that's not all it takes for something to be a good movie.The plot was interesting, but not compelling enough to last 3 hours. The pace was very slow and without subtitles I had so much trouble understanding a word they were saying.The ending was really good and the tension was built up well. But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them. If there was just one character who was less corrupt or had an amusing personality, I would have had less of a problem sitting around watching this movie, but it was just boring.\n",

            "Review 206: When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time.\n",

            "Review 207: Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.Hardly something worthy of praise. The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film.\n",

            "Review 208: The Godfather has influenced every gangster film that has been made since. In terms of mannerisms, quotes, story line and characters.Vito Corleone is also known as Don Corleone, who is the head of the Corleone Crime family, who are one of the five crime families in the Italian Mafia that rule America. Don Corleone meets a drug dealer named Sollazzo who wants to make a deal involving narcotics, the Don who has old fashioned value see's this as a threat and rejects the offer only to be gunned down. The Corleone kids, Sonny, Tom, Michael and Fredo must unite to hold their family and organisation together. And for Michael the youngest, things will never be the same again.The Godfather is a masterpiece. There are endless scenes in the movie that strike a strong and powerful cord with the audience. From the first scene which shows Don Corleone sort out a problem to the violent death of his son and the rise of Michael.Although made in 1972, still connects with people today. Its a different type of family movie like someone previously reviewed. It holds a strong sense of loyalty and what one will do if they are pushed beyond their limits. The cast is perfect; Marlon Brando is amazing as the ageing Don, while James Caan plays the hot headed Sonny perfectly and Diane Keaton, Robert Duvall give a great performance. But it is Al Pacino who shines. He portrays the innocent young man who vows to never be like his family only to plunge himself into darkness in order to protect his beloved family.A masterpiece. A masterpiece that has effected the world when it comes to gangster movies.\n",

Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker \"movies\" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!\n",

This movie has two layers. Boring, barely audible speech, and explosions. I didn't think it to be possible, but even the EXPLOSIONS were boring. Where does the fascination for this movie come from? Marlon Brando may have been a good early actor, but this \"i'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" old man voice is so irritating i almost threw the DVD out the window, however, the movie ended up numbing all my extremities so that it was impossible to move as i had no choice but to sit on in horror. I'm sorry i ever wasted my time on this piece of garbage. With a weak premise, ludicrous character designs, and a plot that could cure insomnia, Godfather sleeps with the fishes, with a 1 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 213: A young Turk is asked to take over the family business. The only problem is that business is a franchise of New York's Murder Inc.The bones of the original Godfather have been so raked over that there doesn't seem a lot left of the corpse to examine. I almost passed on it until I read some of the other reviews which miss so many important points.Yes, great acting (Brando as the old Don and the Pacino as the new will never get better parts). Yes, great directing (Francis Ford Coppola). Yes, a great musical score (Nino Rota). But, nevertheless it is a film that won't quite a settle in my own mind. The information we are given on screen, while believable, is only a selected view of organised crime. I might even argue that it is a cop-out view.I saw this film as a child and was, then, unable to stand back and examine it as a whole. I wanted the cheap bang-bang, the stripped suits and the violin cases. I was bored by the central theme and thought that watching it (for three hours!) was a bit of a chore. Even today it is a bit slow, but I am now an adult and I can see all the things I missed first time around, not all of which flatters.Not that the central theme passed me by: The corruption of the innocent and the rights of passage. How many other people - other than Mafia sons - are born with a destiny? Members of the royal family, sure, but who else? Offspring's of Frank Sinatra (perhaps referred to, obliquely, in this movie) and Elvis Presley haven't even entered show biz no matter tried to take their father's crown. To tell such a story there is few other places that Director Francis Ford Coppola could go but to the mob.Here you have it all: Wealth, politics, extreme violence, corporate problems, the psychology of power, double standards: The whole world of lies, truths and half-truths all together in one place. They say the devil has all the best tunes, but he has a few good film scripts in his locker too.Coppola was nervous as a kitten back then. He introduces the characters in a good light and tries to highlight the good before we see the other side (and often it is not lingered on). He knows full well the audience could be lost before it is won. So no medals for bravery. We see the wealth and power, in clear visuals, but we don't see where the money comes from. Where are the beatings, the robbery and the drug addictions that the mob perpetrate?  The bricks and mortar of the  Long Island mansion that we see before us.The family is not involved in drugs (and is against them) says the old Don at a \"sit down\"? How do we know? Crime is freelance, the only role of the mob is protection  of its members which means a share of the money they earn out of direct sight.(You could say that this sight-unseen street crime puts the cotton wool in Marlon Brando's mouth!)Pornography and vice he doesn't have a problem with - although we don't see it and don't, in the main, care. Women are just another commodity \"that corporations cannot provide.\"Killing seems to be sacred (a theme we see repeated in this series). Pacino doesn't have to kill (it wouldn't have been beyond his wits to have the job done by others) but does so. As a vengeful killer he is real deal - as a non killer he is the baby-faced \"college boy\".The film does little for women. They are all hand-wringers or professional lookers of the other way. Either that or victims. OK feminism wasn't around back then, but good actresses such as Talia Shire and Diane Keaton don't have a memorable line between them.Many of the faults of the first part were put right in the second. We see how power was taken (not given) through the barrel of a gun and some of the home truths that Godfather (Part One) tiptoes around. Nevertheless three hours is a lot of screen time not to have a few minutes to look at what these people leave behind - namely innocent victims...\n",

            "Review 216: The Godfather (1972) **** (out of 4) Francis Ford Coppola's epic masterpiece adapted from Mario Puzo's novel about crime lord Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his attempt to keep his family from going in the wrong direction. Everything imaginable has already been said about this movie so there's not too many reasons to go back through it. Having recently watched the movie theatrical as part of Paramount's re-release, I must say that knowing the film and story so closely allowed me to just sit back and enjoy what Coppola put on the screen. What really struck me is how there are so many reasons why this film shouldn't have worked yet everything came together so perfectly. People know about the studio not wanting Brando and Al Pacino but can you imagine what would have happened had neither one been here? I've never felt this was anywhere near Brando's greatest performance and in fact I might not even place it in the top ten. That's not saying anything against his work here but it speaks for how great he was. I think the most impressive thing was seeing how well he could play someone elderly. Just think that he followed this up with LAST TANGO IN Paris and it just shows what all he could do. With Pacino it has been said that the studio didn't like the rushes they were seeing involving some of his early stuff like at the wedding. Watching these scenes it's easy to see why they'd be nervous but just check out the sequence when his character takes on the responsibility of going to the restaurant. It's really like Pacino the legend is born in this scene and that brilliant scene is like us seeing what was to follow in his career. Not only is there Brando and Pacino but also Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, John Cazale and Abe Vigoda turning in masterful performances. Another thing that really sticks out is how brave Coppola was for letting the story takes its time. There are many, many slow moments here where we get dialogue scenes that get dragged out. Everyone mentions the wedding sequence but this is a perfect example of where the slowness is such a benefit as it really gets you on the inside of understanding how this family works. Coppola allowing the film to takes its time was a dangerous move but it really pays off because there's not another film like this. A lot of future movies tried to copy the style and this certainly slow, building drama but none of them were as successful. Nino Rota's music is simply irresistible and the opening cords as the movie opens are just chilling. The cinematography is some of the most amazing you're ever going to see and the lighting here is among the greatest ever. Especially effective are the scenes inside the Don's office and how the light was used. THE GODFATHER isn't going to get my vote as the greatest movie of all time, of the decade or even the greatest gangster picture. With that said, there's no question that this is still a essential part of American film history and with so much talent involved it's just amazing to watch it today and admire what all they were able to accomplish.\n",

            "Review 217: This is, no doubt, an iconic movie/series and I have seen it reference multiple times in other movies and shows. ( You've Got Mail - Tom Hanks and horse head scene, Serendipity, Everybody Loves Raymond, and even in the animated movie Zootopia and so on and so on) But after watching all 3 Parts over the course of 3 consecutive nights I can assure you, as I have also read from others, I won't be watching this again.The series follows the lives of Vito Corleone and his son Michael in a blood dripping, gut wrenching drama that spans nearly 9 hours (Credits not included). It unfolds in a series of events centered around the power, manipulation, and revenge of the mafia. And by the end you can't help but feel like this is a modern day Hamlet - \"Everyone dies\".I read comments about how the acting was bad, the accents were a joke, and this series, even more specifically, part I is overrated. And while I don't fully share in that \"sentiment\" and I certainly won't forget this movie, I simply couldn't watch it again. The drama, the drawn out events, the moments of intensity and suspenseful thrill isn't something I'd really care to experience again in this facet.But the main theme that I took from this is, simply, \"revenge reaps more revenge\". And to see old Michael Corleone sit in his chair as he dies, naturally, in Part III wasn't all that satisfying after seeing what preceded the course of his life and that of his fathers'. Bearing in mind that anything in relation to the mafia isn't supposed to have a fairytale ending, so it's not as though my expectations were that of the contrary - it's just not my preference.In my opinion the acting WAS good, I didn't feel like the accents were bad at all, and if I were to imagine, the plot probably followed quite closely to how things would go in real life. Which is simply another reason why I just wouldn't want to watch it again.As I am very much of an Italian, myself, I can have an appreciation for various parts of the movie(s) - the scenes from Italy, the family life, the head of the household and all that follows. And although I wouldn't necessarily discourage anyone from watching it, I could certainly understand if they were to only watch it once.In case the R rating didn't give any indication to the type of movie that this is there is definitely a lot of graphic violence, quite a bit of foul language (even more as you continue you into Part II and especially Part III), and even partial nudity in part I - this should clearly go without saying but, Obviously, not a movie I'd watch with any kids around.I will give you a fair warning that throughout all 3 parts there will be moments of confusion for you filled with questions but all will be set straight when the credits roll.\n",

            "Review 218: Although I have a high regard for THE GODFATHER as a gutsy crime melodrama, I would not place it as the #1 film of all time. That place in cinema history should still go to GONE WITH THE WIND, in my opinion.But it's a brilliant piece of work, gorgeously photographed, extremely well crafted throughout with everyone in the cast perfectly suited to their roles.I read the Mario Puzo novel and it's as though each actor was hand- picked for their roles with uniform precision. Highest ranking among the performances are MARLON BRANDO (although I needed the caption feature to catch all of his mumbled words), AL PACINO, who practically carries the main part of the story with a very earnest, very strong portrayal of the favorite son, JAMES CAAN as the hot-headed Sonny, and DIANE KEATON as the romantic interest (Kay) for Pacino. All of the others do stand-out work, particularly RICHARD COSTELLANO as Clemenza.Rumors that some of the details reflect the story behind Frank Sinatra's desperate quest for the role of Maggio in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY are apparently quite true. After all, here the crooning son who needs to save his fading singing career is eager to get a serious role in a war film that is just right for his own Italian persona. We learn that his sweetheart is also the object of lust by a studio head who has spent millions turning her into a studio star only to risk losing her as a property if she marries the crooner. Sound familiar? It should. Think Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra. Or even Sinatra and Kim Novak. (Is Harry Cohn the lecherous producer???) But just how many of these details are true, I don't know. I like to think that author Mario Puzo invented some of them.Aside from this aspect of the story, which culminates in a very famous and bloody comeuppance for the uncooperative producer, there are plenty of other gripping sequences where we know something bad is about to happen because of the various injustices within the crime families. This is the hook that ties all of the sequences together and maintains suspense right up until the final touching scene.A brilliant piece of work--but still not at the top of my \"favorite movie\" list. It's a well-structured crime story by a man who really knew how to write for this genre--and a man (Francis Ford Coppola) who really knew how to direct this sort of crime melodrama, so meticulously detailed and realistically set in the 1940s.\n",

            "Review 219: One of the most boring movies I have ever watched. It felt like a Lifetime movie except for the angry wife seeking revenge it is angry men seeking revenge. The movie starts out with no back story to introduce the characters, who they are, where they are in life and a why to it all while introducing their goals or life plans. As the story progresses the characters do not grow as humans and develop more depth, to the contrary they go in the opposite direction they become less mature and even less human. They lose any depth they had and seem to be motivated entirely by revenge and greed. It is not an antihero story where the main character's motives and means is questionable but ultimately relatable and you feel if you were in the position you might or at least would be tempted to do the same, it's more of a childish jerk story where they seem to be very childish meaning impulsive, over reacting and not thought out well in terms of long term consequences. It is an incredibly slow moving movie and I just finished the movie not a full 15 minutes ago and if you were to show me a picture of a character and ask me who it is, I don't think I could tell you because the writing is so sloppy that you don't build a connection with the characters that make you care about what happens to them, as I was watching the film I was hoping for murders because it would have added some action to an incredibly slow film and because it would mean the end was nearing.\n",

            "Review 220: Does \"Godfather\" romanticize crime and criminals? Yes, it does. Take, for instance, the Godfather's name \"Corleone\" which translates as \"Lionhearted,\" suggesting that the heroes are to be compared to Richard the Lionhearted, legendary chivalrous hero of the Crusades and friend to Robin Hood. There can be no doubt that author Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola have made romantic idols of the Corleones, as the film gilds them with mystery, honor and gallantry. But of what Holy Crusade are the Corleones the leaders? Seemingly a war for survival against vicious enemies who would destroy their gang. But why should we care what happens to a bunch of evil criminals? \"Godfather\" is just as much interesting for what it fails to show the audience as what it does show. The film makers wrongly assume that the audience is sophisticated enough to infer the kind of lurid but educational scene that made such a great success of earlier gangster films, nitty gritty illustrations of the inside workings of organized crime: loan sharking, extortion and vice. \"Godfather\" for the most part ignores this subject matter, the everyday business of crime, in favor of what should be only the end part of its story: a war between gangs over control of the rackets. The drama is essentially without motivation. The movie is simply not interested in showing us much of the dirty business that is the reason for the war. That is because the heroes would seem much less chivalrous if their criminal enterprises were shown in any depth or with any real understanding. For most of its length, the movie plays as a revenge tragedy in which the gallant protagonists could be members of any great family (whether criminal or not) protecting their cherished honor.Why did the film makers deliberately sanitize the criminal aspect of the Corleone family? Are they apologists for crime? I think they are. One confidence game employed by the film makers, which is also familiar among the annals of organized crime leaders, is a variation on the trick called \"bait and switch.\" We expect a portrait of a ruthless and immoral criminal, instead we are made to believe in the essential moral rightness of Don Corleone when he condemns as a contemptible enemy the kind of criminal who trades in narcotics. In other words, we are lured into the theater with the promise of a true to life depiction of the actions of a bad guy, and then the film makers slyly pull a fast one and show us a good guy instead! (We are persuaded to ignore the fact that the Godfather is an extortionist and pimp  even worse we are asked to believe that extortion and pimping are not so bad, especially if practiced by an honorable guy like Don Corleone, who, whatever his failings, is much too decent to trade in narcotics.) This jiggery pokery was so effective that around the time the movie and its sequel came out an ivy league educated friend of mine on his way to a brilliant career on Wall Street bitterly denounced a critic of \"Godfather\" for making the claim that Don Corleone was not entitled to be regarded as a great hero like President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General Douglas MacArthur or Doctor Albert Schweitzer, who had received similarly adulatory treatment in film. My friend, having seen both Godfathers, was convinced that a Mafia leader might be just as honorable as the heroic portrait the movies presented.So, I feel some need on this occasion to remind the public of what the Mafia does, even when they allegedly refuse to get involved in narcotics sales. The Mafia is mainly in the business of Vice. It feeds off the weaknesses of a mass of little people who are corruptible, who are vulnerable to the appeal of easy sex, cheap thrills, quick money and quick fixes of their problems. These little people pay for their vices all their lives, much more than they can afford to pay, and end up ruined for the greater glory of the Mafia. Most racket crime is not glorious; it is petty and mean and easily committed by anyone who has less courage or daring than the average person. But it's easy to understand why the film makers left this out of the movie. It would be kind of absurd to call a scuzzy dirtbag by the name \"Lionheart.\"\n",

That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments. This film, like the old Cagney films before it, paved the way for some other great Gangster Flicks that came rolling along through the years after it, but this stands on the top of the Mountain as the Godfather of all them......\n",

            "Review 224: Italian films have quite often come under some sort of controversy, in large part because of the fact that Italian immigrants have been given an undeserved reputation of being inherently violent and universally tied to some sort of organized crime. Mass media is one of the main reasons for this, which is why Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather instigated such fierce opposition and controversy when it was released in 1972. Coppola has insisted that the film is not about Italians involved in organized crime, but that it is instead a metaphorical representation of the American government. Personally, I don't believe that at all, if only because no one is going to watch a film like that and overlook exactly what they see and make the connection between the film and the American government.\n",
            "However, this does not take away from the overall accomplishment that the film makes. The genius of The Godfather lies in Coppola's obvious directing skills, as well as author Mario Puzo's skill as a storyteller. The film tells the story of five tremendously powerful crime families that are at war with one another, but no one seems to be quite sure who committed the crimes that instigated the war, which makes for an interesting investigation as a subplot. Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone is one of the best in history, and one of the major accomplishments of the film as a whole is that it is able to take this man, who is really a despicable person, and make him into an endearing character that we really care about. He is the leader of a crime family, but he is made into an antagonist. The film twists things around like that, which is one of the things that really makes it so watch-able. Aside from making Don Corleone into such a likeable character, he is also made to be tremendously respectable. Personally, I noticed this because I watched The Godfather again recently while going through and watching all of the James Bond films. Here is James Bond, who is supposed to be one of the most tasteful, refined, and high-class figures in action film, and Brando's Don Corleone effortlessly makes even Sean Connery's Bond look like a Spice Girl. The story of The Godfather is complex and involved enough to have taken up three very long films, and they are tied together brilliantly. This film ends with Vito Corleone's son Michael taking over his leadership position, in a scene that doesn't only leave room for a sequel, but demands one. The film ends with Michael Corleone in his father's office, being addressed by two of his father's assistants as Don Corleone, a title attributed only to his father until that point in the film. It would have been an unsatisfactory to end the film that way without continuing the story, and this was done two years later, with yet another Best Picture winner. The Godfather is a landmark in film history, because of the incredible story, the astronomical performances, the expert direction, and the picture perfect cinematography. The film is literally packed with memorable and famous scenes, and the performances from everyone involved are spectacular. Even at three hours, The Godfather never gets boring or slow. It is a stunningly intense ride from beginning to end.\n",

I think that people hear that its the best movie made then automatically accept this opinion and convince themselves it is. The scene with the horses head was ridiculous really. Acting by Brando was at best mediocre and James Caan is useless . I don't even reckon FFC as a director either, especially after Gangs Of New York. If this was made in present day it would probably flop. The 2 sequels got worse and the supporting characters never seemed to fit in.I would imagine the book is a million times better. The only redeeming feature for me was seeing Al Pacino honing his acting skills he used so brilliantly used in the later Serpico and Scarface.

            "Review 226: This, probable the best known of all Mafia movies, opens on post war New York and is centred on the Corleone crime family. In particular it tells of Don Vito Corleone, its aging patriarch, and his son Michael, who he hope will succeed outside the business. It is a time of change for organised crime; there are those who believe the future lies in the supply of illegal narcotics something Don Vito believes will lead to their destruction as the authorities won't turn a blind eye like they do to illicit gambling. It isn't long before an attempt is made on his life. After that Michael is pulled into the business as he seeks revenge. Soon a mob war is triggered and nobody is truly safe.To call a film 'sprawling' might not be considered a compliment but here it is meant as one; for almost three hours we are shown ten years in the lives of one family. Highs and lows. It is a story that will see Michael transform from the man he wants to be to the man circumstances force him to be. It isn't a story that glorifies the mafia; it shows that these 'men of honour' have little... the day you are told your safety is assured is the day you are killed. The cast is great with Marlon Brando impressing in his oft imitated performance as Don Vito and Al Pacino doing a really fine job as Michael, a character who changes believably as events affect him. The rest of the cast, which includes James Caan, Robert Duvall. Sterling Hayden and Diane Keaton are also great. Director Francis Ford Coppola does a great job bringing the story to the screen, helped by a fine soundtrack from Nino Rota. Overall I'd say this is a must see for all fill fans.\n",

            "Review 232: The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972.\n",

            "Review 233: RELEASED IN 1972 and directed by Francis Ford Coppola, \"The Godfather\" stars Marlon Brando as the aging don of an Italian mafia dynasty in the 1940s who decides to transfer control of his clandestine empire to his hesitant but formidable son, Michael (Al Pacino); meanwhile a gangster war breaks out between the five Mob families in the New York City area.MAIN CAST: James Caan plays the tough son, Sonny; Robert Duvall plays the adopted lawyer son, Tom; and John Cazale plays the weakest Corleone son, Fredo, who's basically exiled to Vegas. Diane Keaton & Simonetta Stefanelli play Michael's American and Sicilian babes respectively. Talia Shire appears as the \"hysterical\" sister of the Corleone family, Connie, and Gianni Russo her duplicitous, abusive husband. Al Martino plays Johnny Fontane, the singer of dubious talents inspired by Frank Sinatra.I'm not big on gangster flicks because it's hard to work up compassion for protagonists who are criminal scum. I usually can't wait for them to be wiped off the face of the earth (or sent to prison for life, sharing a cell with Bubba). But, if you can handle this element, \"The Godfather\" is a great Mobster movie and one of the greatest gangster flicks ever. This is basically a drama with flashes of brutal, shocking hoodlum-oriented violence.Highlights abound, starting with Brando's great performance, well displayed in the opening scene, and the awesome mid-40s ambiance. The restaurant sequence is suspense at finest. Other great scenes include the Beverly Hills horse bit; a rugged henchman unexpectedly garroted; Michael's rescue of his father at a deserted hospital (which is reminiscent of a similar sequence in 1968's \"Bullitt\"); the assassination in the reeds; the brief-but-potent \"love at first sight\" moment in Sicily; Sonny's beating the snot out of a deserving POS; the sudden explosive death of a loved one; the unexpected tollbooth sequence; Vito playing with his grandson in the garden with an orange peel in his mouth; and the baptism sequence juxtaposed with Michael's men carrying out their wicked deeds.What's the moral of the story? The ending tells all: Choosing a life in league with organized crime will turn you into a hypocritical, lying, murderous fool.THE FILM RUNS 2 hours & 55 minutes and was shot in the New York City area; Sicily; Las Vegas; and Beverly Hills, California.

            "Review 234: Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' is often voted amongst the best films of all time, but watching it today, it's surprising how conservative it feels. That's not necessarily a bad thing, though, for, it's undoubtedly a piece of film-making of the highest class; but also a slow, stately epic that one could not imagine being made today in quite the same form (the contrast with Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', for example, shows clearly the direction in which film-making has evolved). On the other hand, to be fair to 'The Godfather', one must note how much it has influenced the gangster films that have succeeded it, perhaps making it seem more orthodox than it was at the time of its release (there are even stories that it influenced the real life mafia!). Of course, there's something conservative in the very idea of a gangster story, with its appeal to ideas of tradition and respect, even if the need for a plot means that such tales must inevitably focus on period when the traditional codes are breaking down (and the need for honesty must expose the extent to which they are a sham anyway). 'The Godfather' does both these things, in what is ultimately, behind the superficial subject matter, a story of personal transformation, that of Al Pacino's clean-cut college kid into the true successor of his mafioso father (played by Marlon Brando). The fact that this was arguably Brando's last great, complete, cinematic performance, as well as Pacino's first, has undoubtedly added to the movie's iconic status. Overall, I can't quite agree that this is the best movie ever: for all its sweep, it's a tale of people lacking a certain core of humanity, and therefore lacks the emotional intensity of my very favourite films. But it's still a mighty thing, worthy of its place in the cinematic canon.\n",

            "Review 235: The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.Grade B\n",

Rich, powerful and socially well-placed, this family leads one of the most important criminal cartels in New York, as one of the Mafia's \"five families\". Inadvertently drawn into a war with another family, the Corleone's will, throughout the film, showing their human side, as well as they will be able of the most cruel and vindictive acts.Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this film needs no introduction. It's the cinema adaptation of a novel by Mario Puzo, who collaborated in the writing of the script, which is one of the best scripts of twentieth century cinema. In addition to this director and this script, we should highlight the cast, full of stars (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and others) who gave us an \"offer we cannot refuse\": a masterpiece that anyone should watch at least once.If there is a movie where there is no possible negative note, is this: the suspense is permanent, the Nino Rota's soundtrack is unforgettable and even the light contributes to the heavy and gloomy atmosphere that makes us wait for the moment we'll hear the next gun shots. Winner of three Oscars (Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay), five Golden Globes (Best Film, Best Leading Actor: Drama, Best Screenplay, Best Original Score and Best Director) and a BAFTA (Best Soundtrack), this film received several other nominations and awards and is considered by many the best gangsters movie ever, and one of the best films of the twentieth century.

            "Review 238: I had to watch the entire trilogy and reflect on the films for a while before I realized what a great film \"The Godfather\" is. As I watched all three films, I really got familiar with all of the characters and became more intrigued as the series went on. Looking back, I felt that this first film was the greatest of the trilogy for several reasons. First of all, it has Marlon Brando, who portrays the amazing character Vito Corleone. This is one of the most memorable, imitated, and lovable characters in film history. His character is masterfully balanced as a powerful mafia patriarch and a loving family man. For this he won a well-deserved Best Actor Oscar. I also prefer this film because Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is a hero rather than the villain he later becomes. As Vito Corelone is wounded by an enemy, Michael must take over leading his empire while he is recovering. The interactions between the characters is excellent here, as is the film's dialogue. There is also a great supporting cast, consisting of Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and more. What a well-crafted story. Part II is almost as good, but I think this is slightly better. Close to perfect.***1/2 out of ****\n",

            "Review 239: The Godfather Part 1 is genuinely one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. And I guess in the opinion of many, many other people too. The only reason I add the \"my opinion\" part is because I don't want it to seem like I'm suggesting it definitely is objectively one of the greatest of all time, because objectivity as a concept is kind of silly, and also because if someone doesn't like the film, or was disappointed by it, that's totally okay. I think it's perfectly normal to watch a classic film and feel as though something's off. I've lost count of the number of classics I'd say I \"appreciate\" whilst not particularly \"enjoying.\"But the original The Godfather for me is the rare film where I both appreciate and love it to an amazingly high degree. This is a nearly three-hour film that packs so much into its runtime that every time I watch it, I'm blown away. I've seen it on so many occasions that I know what's going to happen to who, and when, but there are still sequences where I'm on the edge of my seat. It doesn't matter that I know the outcome; the execution of many scenes still blows me away. Al Pacino's character facing a particular moral dilemma at a restaurant is one of my favourite sequences of all time, and really, I only single that one out because if I didn't limit myself, I could call every scene an iconic scene...... Okay, I can't help it. I also want to rave about the opening scene, especially because I find it best to avoid spoilers (yes, even for old movies. I was born almost 25 years after The Godfather. I couldn't really watch it until 15 years after that at the earliest. You can't tell me I \"had 40 years to watch it so too bad about getting spoiled\"... sorry, mid-review spoiler rant over). The opening wedding scene lasts a very long time, and the first time I watched it I may have thought it was a tad overlong (from memory, I had this at a 4.5/5 for a couple of years, then bumped it up to a 5/5 after my first rewatch). But, knowing the story better, and being a little more patient perhaps at an older age, I think the opening scene is incredible. Beyond being beautifully shot and constructed, and beyond the iconic opening monologue and first shot of the film, it's a fantastic achievement in writing.We get almost all the main characters introduced in a short amount of time, understand who they are and where they stand, what their basic personalities are, and just why Brando's central mob boss character is so revered and feared. Sure, Michael explaining things to his girlfriend may seem like an easy way to convey some of this information, but it's not a crutch, and honestly I think it's organic enough. It's a huge, long movie with a lot going on, and so a long, dense, but still extremely engaging opening scene is needed to allow that story to progress properly.Almost every scene after that opening scene is fantastic. The one part of the film I don't love is really the film's second sequence in Hollywood, but it's quite brief and still so far from bad. It might just suffer because it comes after a great opening and before approximately two hours of truly iconic stuff (it does feature an infamously memorable climax though, of course).Really, just about everything in the film is beyond top-notch. Brando and Pacino have seldom been better, and that's saying something, and all the other supporting performances- including the crazily underrated Robert Duvall- deserve almost just as much praise. The music is beautiful, the look of the film amazing, the emotional stuff is devastating, and the violence still packs a surprisingly brutal punch (that one dodgy beatdown delivered by Caan's character aside).If you haven't seen it yet, I'd still say go in with moderate expectations. You might love it, you might like it, you might respect it but find it a bit dull... but the less expectations you have, the clearer your response will be. I say that after hyping the movie up a whole lot, I'll admit, but those are my honest thoughts and feelings. I understand its status as a classic and gladly count it among my personal favourite movies. Part 2 is also very good, but I've never loved it as much as Part 1. Part 3 is a step down in quality, but I don't hate it. It has the most flaws of all the films, but there's some stuff in there I like too.Anyway, watch this first one if you haven't yet, and go on from there with either Part 2 or maybe Part 2 & 3 if you like it. I think the first Godfather has the reputation it has for a reason, and deserves at least one viewing by just about every fan of film at least once in their lifetime.\n",

            "Review 240: This was the biggest grossing film in 1972 when it was released and I am told that it follows closely to the Mario Puzo novel of the same name. The movie is followed by two sequels, which at first I believed were a part of the novel, but later realised that in fact they were separate. They seem to all meld together into one epic, though I will treat them all as separate movies, though I will refer back to the previous films occasionally.In this movie (which I believe to be the best) we watch the internal and external struggles of the Corleone family and how things slowly change in the life of young Michael Corleone. Michael (Al Pachino) is the central character in the film, though the others of his family, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), Sonito Corleone (James Caan), and Tom Hagan (Robert Duval) are of importance. Looking at the cast though, there are some very competent, and surprising, actors that appear in here. In fact I was surprised to see Diane Keaton (who plays Kay Adams, Michael Corleone's wife) in the film, but then I only just recently saw it for the first time.This movie is a tale of epic proportions and we watch here how Michael changes through the events of the movie. In the background of war and violence in the streets of New York, Michael, who wants to remain distant from the criminal ways of his family, yet feeling ties of loyalty to his family, is slowly pulled into it. The turning point comes when he is in the hospital to find that all of his father's guards have vanished and he has to make a decision to remain apart from the criminal aspects of his family, or to dive in and save his father's life.I guess one of the major things here is that you are what you are. No matter how much Michael tries to deny his family's business, he cannot escape the inevitable fact that it is criminal. Even though he could simply walk away from him family, he feels loyal and devoted to him, and even though his father his a criminal, he loves him.Another interesting thing that I read was in regards to the treatment of women in the film. The film is divided into spheres: the domestic and the business sphere. In the movie all of the women are in the domestic sphere and are not allowed to enter into the business sphere. The movie also details violence towards women to force them into that domestic role. We have the woman that is talked about at the beginning who is violently violated and the man seeking justice. We have the young Corrie who is married at the beginning, kept away from the family business, and beaten up when she refuses to work in the domestic sphere. We have Michael's first wife who is learning to drive, only to be blown up when she starts the car and finally there is Kay Adams, who at the end of the movie is shut out of the business end of the family, after being lied to by Michael.The movie also deals with respect, in a little bit. At the beginning, Marlon Brando gives a monologue regarding how the man petitioning him only comes to him when he is in trouble, and is never treating him as a friend or even a Godfather. It is not that he does not want to help him, but that he would like to be a friend to the man as opposed to somebody who is only visited when there is trouble.This movie is epic in proportions, but it is too detailed in places. It is long, and even though some long movies, such as Thin Red Line, are good despite their length, others are simply way too long to really want to sit down and watch. In fact, it took me a while to actually sit and watch these movies because of their length.\n",

And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time. Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.

            "Review 243: While some argue that \"The Godfather\" glorifies violence, I beg to differ. Director Francis Ford Coppola seems to use violence to expose his characters' collective guilt and sacrilege. Their hypocritical displays of piety culminate in the Baptism scene, cleverly juxtaposed with a mob hit, shedding light on the family's duplicity. Even the women in the story play their part in this charade, enabling the men's heinous crimes.\"The Godfather\" serves as a stark reminder of the American tragedy it represents. However, it might occasionally overemphasize this point, and it lacks the extensive humor seen in more modern Mafia portrayals, like \"The Sopranos,\" which offered multi-dimensional character development.The characters in \"The Godfather\" are somewhat one-dimensional-stereotypical figures who are clearly defined: Don Corleone, the soft-spoken tyrant demanding \"respect\"; Sonny, the hothead; Michael, the control freak who believes he's above the family's violence; and Fredo, the cowardly black sheep.Among the supporting characters, the mobsters are well-played and entertaining. The likes of Clemenza, Sollozzo, Luca Brasi, Barzini, and McCluskey breathe life into the film, each contributing to the ensemble. However, the entertainment value wanes when show business personalities are portrayed unsympathetically, especially \"godson\" Johnny Fontaine, who channels Frank Sinatra.The female characters are intentionally marginalized to highlight the patriarchal society's abuse. A poignant scene depicts Connie, Don Corleone's only daughter, being attacked by her husband Carlo, underscoring the women's subjugation. Even Kay, Michael's fiancée, who knows he's as ruthless as the rest, agrees to marry him despite all the red flags.\"The Godfather\" has its moments of suspense, especially during an assassination attempt on the Don's life. The near-second hit at the hospital, Michael's transformation after his father is shot, and his subsequent revenge at the Italian restaurant keep the narrative engaging and offset any claims of slow pacing.The scenes in Italy, chronicling Michael's exile and his romantic involvement with the woman who becomes his wife, may seem a bit slow and less believable, primarily due to the culture clash. However, they might be aiming to portray Michael's quest for an \"obedient\" partner.The second half of the film holds enough captivating events to keep audiences entertained, including Sonny's demise, the Hollywood takeover, the Godfather's death (portrayed as an unremarkable event), and the final reckoning of those who plotted against the Don.Marlon Brando's performance in \"The Godfather\" is memorable, despite being perhaps a touch too young for the role. Al Pacino, on the other hand, is constrained by a script that leaves his character humorless and largely unsympathetic. Similar sentiments apply to James Caan, whose role as a one-dimensional hothead lacks depth.\"The Godfather\" might not achieve the grand tragedy it aims for, repeatedly highlighting the family's moral decay. Nonetheless, it offers an entertaining ride. Nino Rota's brilliant score, often a Fellini collaborator, almost turns \"The Godfather\" into a decent approximation of a Fellini film.\n",

            "Review 244: The USA have reached a point of no return in 1972 that is going to lead them to their final defeat in Vietnam and their tremendous decline in the world. At this moment too the consumer's society has produced a new need in western societies, the need for some artificial paradise that could compensate the materialistic narrow-mindedness of modern life, the lack of spirituality in mass consumption. This paper tiger of a paradise is brought by drugs. The drug market explodes, and first of all in the USA. The mafia is confronted to this problem in New York and elsewhere. The older generation of the Godfather refuses this evolution and that brings some kind of confrontation among the five families or clans and the police of course that tries to put their hands on the profit without soiling their fingers. At the same time the Godfather is brought to realising that he has to let a younger generation take over. First an agreement is reached about drugs : drug trafficking will be accepted but regulated. No drugs to minors and in schools, and drugs in priority to the dark ones, the blacks in an attempt to keep this « cancer » contained in the most hated community in the US. This though is not enough to pacify the streets of New York. The Godfather's death is the signal for one of his surviving sons, appointed guardian of the business by the godfather himself, to take over. It is done in the most typical method of the mafia : the five families are decimated at their heads, including the Corleone family. The new Godfather eliminates his brother in law who is responsible for the death of one of the brothers. Brutal, ruthless, pacifying for sure for a while but the promise that with time vengeance will bring strife again. The depicting of power in a feudal system like that of the Sicilian mafia based on the signoria, on the absolute autonomy of each family and their right to defend their territories and their interests by any means including killing, including children and women. Francis Ford Coppola takes a very visible pleasure in this depiction that he complacently shows in its very minute details of cruelty and viciousness.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne\n",

            "Review 246: This is one of my favorite movies of all time. It is part of the reason that Al Pacino is my favorite actor as well. I saw this movie when I was in high school for the first time when I was diving into mafia and crime movies. I've seen this a handful of times since then. Despite it running shy of three hours, it doesn't feel like it. This most recent viewing was thanks to the Internet Movie Database Top 100 poster as well as Jaime never having seen this. Plus, I was watching the Blu-Ray set that my father got me.This movie is based on the novel that was written by Mario Puzo. We are following the Corleone family with the changing of the guard. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) runs the business with his son Sonny (James Caan), lawyer/adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and crew. Michael (Pacino) is home from the war where he was a hero. We see how he gets mixed up with a life he never wanted and becoming the new don.There's not a lot I can say that is new here. This is a classic. The performances are amazing. Francis Ford Coppola was a master in filmmaking with what he did. This movie is just captivating. Jaime doesn't like long movies and she struggled with breaking from it. This is even an older movie and even set in the 1940s into the 50s. That didn't bother her. It feels authentic and seeing how ruthless these people are while keeping their honor is on another level. This is one of the greatest movies of all time for a reason.My Rating: 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 247: In contrast to part 2 this is more loosely structured and sometimes less climactic and also seems more improvised. But thanks to the enormous effort put to detailed cinematography and camera-work it lends itself more to repeated viewings. (One example: when Vito is about to be shot there's a poster on the grocery store announcing a fight of Jake LaMotta thus foreshadowing the assassination attempt).Probably the most interesting is the light and dark contrast between the outer, ordinary world and the inner, godfather world. Even when these two worlds meet in one shot they are still strictly separated by showing two rooms in a way where you watch one world from the other (the end shot e.g. where Kay is seen in one room and the men in another: then the door shuts).Very effective use of mirrors (reflection), doors (separating worlds) and windows (showing perspective). From the back-to-back shots and other shots where an object obscures the picture we can see where many modern filmmakers get their ideas (Kar-Wai for example).Coppola has himself watched Antonioni very well: Scenes where only buildings or spaces are shown to create an alienating effect or just loneliness combined with tension (hospital scene). Or characters disappear and only a static shot of the room is seen to signify emptiness (fight between Connie and Carlo).Especially the end scene is well edited and composed: But they even improved on that scene just two years later.\n",

            "Review 249: A man immigrants to the United States from Italy and has three sons - the oldest is intellectually deficient, the second is a temperamental bully and hothead, and the third, seems well adjusted and normal. Yet looks can be deceiving, for it is the third son, Michael, who is actually more cunning and more depraved than his two older brothers and proves it. Michael is a merchant of death cloaked in the regalia of middle-class civility which makes him even more lethal. Michael never loses his temper; he dresses impeccably; he's a highly decorated army veteran and has an admiring wife, all of which is mere window dressing masking a viciousness and brutality that is without limit. And what is it that Michael wants? Only to protect his family from \"enemies\" who want to destroy his family. Except the enemies are of Michael's making. Al Pacino's portrayal of the sinister Michael Corleone is one of the great and classic performances in the history of movie making. Mr. Pacino fully and effectively projects every nuance of Michael's distorted and depraved character, from his predatory nature as a merciless and cold blooded killer who shoots two men at point-blank range with whom he is having dinner; to his hypocritical flaunting of religion such as using the baptism of his son as a cover while ordering the assassination of some of his supposed \"enemies\"; to his blatant dishonesty such as when he lies right to his wife's face; and to his decision to wantonly murder his own brother-in-law, and thereby make his sister a grieving widow. Marlon Brando got top billing for this movie, but it was Al Pacino who is the real star.\n",

The film is a good watch but for me personally I don't like the gangster subject matter and themes of the film, which I guess is why it's taken me so long to watch it in full.\n",

            "Review 251: The mafia epic to which all others are measured. Maybe even the greatest film of all time, but I don't think that's a fair judgment to cast. In either case, Francis Coppola's much-heralded masterwork, jumbo-sized but not without good reason, still delivers. The sheer ambition of The Godfather is a sight to behold, packed full of strong characters, complicated choices, bitter twists of fate and a grand, decades-spanning arc.It's as close as cinema has ever come to matching the rich, chewy abundance of a great novel, even if it does skim a few years in the third act. We're treated to layers upon layers of comprehensively-defined individuals, even the ancillary roles, with a strikingly complex dynasty at the center of it all. The Corleones are a crucially diverse group, distinct but also alike, fundamentally familiar despite the off-putting nature of the family business. Sonny, the hot-headed heir apparent; Fredo, the kowtowed black sheep; Vito, the rational, well-composed patriarch; Michael, the intellectual firebrand with lofty ideals. In retrospect, their paths are obvious, but in the heat of the moment we're shocked by every twist of the knife. Moments of deep contemplation contrast with explosions of spontaneous violence, loud illustrations of the literal dog-eat-dog nature of this particular line of work.Coppola wrangles everything like the illustrated puppetmaster married to the franchise logo. It's all precisely orchestrated, timed for peak efficiency, yet somehow never grows formulaic or loses touch with its essentially human, organic pulse. Not a wasted movement, nor a missed opportunity. What an achievement, just to complete a film of this magnitude. That it was accomplished in just a year's time, first day of filming to opening day at the cinema, is absolutely baffling.\n",

            "Review 252: This and Godfather II is my favorite of this trilogy. Since the time young Vito arrives at Ellis Island and gets his name changed to Corlione to establishing his Cosa Nostra empire is a human drama told in a grand scale. This is truly a story driven movie. Not the kind of \"fluff\" that people talk about these days where they take a picture, make the cinematography shot in low lighting, have couple of angry or troubled characters (mostly out of self pity) running around and calling it a serious and story driven plot line. The cinematography of this movie is beautiful, people are not overtly \"angry\" or \"troubled\" in any ways (their troubles, and angers are more real), but this movie has a real story to tell(!). This is the expensive original of the cheap imitation people are trying to hock around these days as story driven entertainment.There were days when few great film makers were trying to make money to make their passion - the movie - come into existence, not the other way around. This movie is one of them, and its substance shows. If you watch this movie, you will be treated to the best directing and acting money can buy. A true Gem of a Holly Wood movie making.\n",

The IMDb rating is our guide for watching any film and that infuriates my wife \"Why can't you two just enjoy a film without checking if it's good or not on that website you go on?\" I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just \"business\". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like \"I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker\" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse.\n",

            "Review 256: Hollywood has some strange politics.  Note how Civil War movies tend to favor the Confederacy over the Union, and crime movies almost always favor crooks over cops.  Yet in real life, even if cops annoy us from time to time, I think we prefer them to murderers and thieves.  And even though the Confederacy has a romantic air attached to it, we're all glad that the Union won (the sane ones amongst us, anyhow).  Somehow, movies don't quite reflect what we actually think, and we often end up rooting for protagonists that we would hate in real life.All this build-up leads me to the doubtless controversial statement that I can't really warm to \"The Godfather\" because it's about a bunch of scuzzballs.  I can admire this movie, but I can't love it or relate to it in any way, except maybe as an allegory about the corrupting influence of power.  I can't relate to LOTR either, by the way, and I don't think either film deserves the title of \"bestest picture ever.\"I actually think \"The Godfather: Part II\" is much better, as it's more concerned with family relationships (the \"human\" element) than the boring gangster-vs-gangster conflicts that predominate here.  And I have a theory that people confuse the first two Godfather films in their minds, combining the best elements of both into some kind of uber-picture that doesn't actually exist (people do the same thing with \"Star Wars,\" mistakenly remembering Yoda and \"Luke, I am your father\" as elements from the \"classic\" first film).  Most of the famous Godfather scenes are not here, but in the sequel. Here, we get Brando mumbling incoherently - the performance everyone makes fun of.I prefer \"Donnie Brasco\" because the character development is richer, and even \"A Bronx Tale\" because it has a powerful anti-gangster message, and because it meticulously recreates a specific time and neighborhood (as opposed to this film, which creates a gangster fantasy world).  But generally speaking, I'll take a straight drama - about people who aren't hit men - any day.\n",

In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque.

The acting is top notch, the cinematography is beautiful, the filming locations and sets are perfect, the sound is great, the music is excellent... I could talk about how great this movie is for hours. Francis Ford Coppola has a clear vision for this movie, and is expertly brought to life.The beginning of the film starts out at the wedding of Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie. At the wedding reception we are introduced to the many of the members of the Corleone crime family, however not all of them are part of the \"family business\". At the wedding, Vito's youngest son, Michael, tells his then girlfriend, Kay, that he was not like his family. Throughout the rest of the film, we see Michael Corleone transform into the very thing he claims he hates. It's an excellent example of how character growth should be done.From the intriguing beginning where we find Vito Corleone being asked for favors, to the climatic ending where Michael finishes his transformation, The Godfather is a landmark film in American cinema.\n",

Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about \"important\" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable.

            "Review 266: I remember distinctly the first time I saw \"The Godfather\". I was a child and it was being shown on broadcast television.  Granted, neither of theses are optimal conditions for rendering an informed opinion but I remember being struck with how unremarkable- in fact how boring I found the film.  I was particularly surprised by this, as there had been a great fanfare over the broadcast. I chalked this up to my own immaturity and thought no more of it.The second time I saw the film was in college.  My friend had a brother who was quite a film enthusiast and he, like many others, counted \"The Godfather\" as the finest film.  One evening my friend and I watched the film.  The viewing once again left me unimpressed.  I feigned an enthusiasm for the film that I did not feel, as it seemed the popular, and even the intellectual expectation.  Once again I associated my dislike for the movie with a failing in myself. I apparently did not appreciate a \"good movie\" when I saw one.Since that time I have seen many films, from many directors, from many countries, in many languages, and with varying budgets from independent offerings to mainstream Hollywood fare.  I certainly do not consider myself to be an expert but feel myself to be an informed member of an audience. Armed with my experience I recently viewed \"The Godfather\" again to expunge my previous failures and to gleefully join the ranks of Godfather sycophants.  Well, I think you know the outcome.  As they say in baseball, three strikes and you're out.I find the film to be completely un-redeeming in every way.  I do not have space to address the film systematically or technically so I will speak to my central grievance- the story is hollow.  There is no moral center.I do not demand that a movie have morality.  I do not demand that a film even have a point.  I can take a film at its face value for what it is.  A slapstick comedy is foolish and an action flick is mindless, I do not ask that they be a different movie- only that they meet the narrow definition to which they aspire.  The problem is that \"The Godfather\" aspires to be a great drama and that aspiration comes with high expectations.Gratuitous violence is expected in big-budget action flicks, amorality can be understood in the quiet desperation of an independent film's philosophy, and self-indulgence is to be expected in the over-the-top musical extravaganza.  However, violence, amorality, and self-indulgence in a film that portrays itself as mainstream drama or even tragedy are reprehensible. This is not art- it is base voyeurism at its worst.  We are standing in the bailey at New Castle or at the Coliseum watching with leering stares at the baseness and depravity of man. This film is not a criticism of man's foul nature, as in the above referenced independent film; it is a celebration of it.  Anyone who claims otherwise deludes himself.Thus conceived I can appreciate `The Godfather' as a film oddity, a curious victory of the popularity of evil men.  But to say that it is a great film is scandalous, and to say that it is the greatest film is blasphemous.  To say that the highest achievement of man in film is a celebration of cruelty, deception, and greed is a statement that many should reconsider.I find it interesting that many of those who claim \"The Godfather\" as their favorite film, or the best film of all time can count their viewings of the film on one hand. In fact, I myself (who thinks unfavorably of the film) have given the film more attention then many of the \"fans\" I know.  A friend of mine who professes to like the film recently returned the box-set DVD \"Godfather\" collection that he received for Christmas.  As he put it, he loved the film but when was he ever going to watch it?  That is faint praise indeed for the \"greatest film of all time\".I am sure there are those who genuinely enjoy the film, but you could say that about any movie.  I would advise those who fawn over this film so to ask themselves if their enthusiasm comes from within or from a modern mythology. \"The Godfather\" is a paper tiger.\n",

With an incredible star cast, an incredible director (Francis Ford Coppola) and a strong story (Mario Puzo) this movie surely deserves all the praise that it can get.The Godfather is a three hour movie based on the life of the Italian American Mafioso based on the original novel written by Mario Puzo, who also has written the screenplay along with Coppola for the movie as well. It stars legendary and highly respected actors namely Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, etc.What makes Al Pacino's role particularly tough is the evolution and the development of his character. He starts out as a person who does not want to do anything with the family business and as circumstances change he gradually changes the direction of his life and evolves throughout the movie. And Pacino does it splendidly. Surely his acting skills are not overrated as some might feel.The story is a depiction of bitter reality, a bitter reality that was already put forward in the novel and made more accessible and imaginable in the movie. Perhaps this also explains why some haters of the movie exist. It does not offer the escape from reality many other movies seem to offer and let us face it - it is not a simple, straight story to understand. Though 3 hours in length, many viewers could watch it over and over again and each time a viewer watches it he might understand it in greater depth.The direction is near flawless. This is one huge reason why this movie is always critically on the top spot. Incredible research has been done by Copolla and Puzo in depicting the Mafia world. How does a Don think? How does he protect himself by organizing layers and layers within his empire that render him untouchable by the law? How insecure does he feel? What does he consider when he plans a move? How careful does he have to be in every step that he takes? How does he exploit the whole system around him in order to be the one controlling all the strings (please note the puppeteer's strings in the logo of the movie The Godfather)? These are some of the questions both the movie and the novel try and answer.For those of you who have read the novel, I am pretty sure most of you will not be disappointed. It is the best example of how best can a movie be made out of a splendid novel! And for those who saw this movie and liked it, I'd suggest that you read the novel as well for it shall explain in even greater depth the subtle details of the working machinery of the Mafia empire. And yes, please see The Godfather 2 as well.And may I also add in the end that the second part \"Godfather 2\" is a fulfillment of the first. A must watch for every person who has watched part one.I am sure that this movie is going to retain the honour of its top spot and critical finesse for many years to come.\n",

            "Review 274: Clearly a film masterpiece in every sense of the word. Superb filming of each scene. From the moment of the opening line \"I believe in America\" by the desperate for revenge and justice undertaker Bonasera to the closing line \"Don Corleone\" by the loyal capo Clemenza the viewer watches art in the form of a motion picture.\n",

            "Review 275: This is certainly one of the greatest movies ever made. It's such amazingly well-acted, well-written movie with an epic story line that takes you through many themes like love, sadness, loyalty, revenge and betrayal is such an encompassing and totally believable way. I will never get tired of watching this masterpiece. \"The Godfather\" is one of the few gangster films that connects the members of the Mafia as a family. The cinematography is rich and the music is perfect. However, I failed to see how Marlon Brando's performance was top notch. His acting was decent; he did not move much nor talk much. His voice also was barely understandable due to his croaking voice mumbling what sounded like English. Ultimately \"The Godfather\" still stands up as the best movie in the American crime gen\n",

            "Review 276: So many have already said what this film has. It has an amazing set of actors. The cinematography is as good as it gets. It is intense, gut wrenching, edited flawlessly. It takes an outstanding book and cranks it up a notch. It's hard for me to comment because, as a rule, I don't like movies about organized crime. First, I fear the reality of it. It holds a power in this country that we must always be aware of. It is in so much of our world, more than we realize. I feel at times that glamorizing these individuals is destructive. Nevertheless, I have to put that aside because this is the subject matter and at no time has anyone so masterfully put on screen the portrayal of these thugs, who see themselves as family as Coppola. I got the shivers walking out of the movie. Unlike horror movies where it's over and done with (with the exception of \"Deliverance\" which I will never get out of my mind), this haunts one for days after. I watched this again a few weeks ago, and what we have is a milieu that separates itself from out mundane existences. These people choose to live in a violent world of their own choosing. One issue that always gets me is, how do they enjoy the fruits of their \"labor\"? It seems that a hell on earth is created for them. The unfortunate thing is that they push that hell onto their victims in the name of family.\n",

To me, it just epitomizes the big dumb knock people over the head with a club, speak like you dropped out of school in fourth grade sort of guy movie. I'm a guy. I like guy movies, but I don't like this one.Brando I like pretty well. Pacino too. Hell, probably half the cast I am very fond of. Why can't I like this movie? I don't know, but it has just never made me feel anything but annoyance and boredom. The problem is people over-hype it and make me want to try to like it. Every time I try to watch it, it's the same thing though.So sorry, this movie just isn't great.\n",

Even if you don't like gangster movies you need to watch this classic, you are going to find really good but really good performances, i'm just going to highlight these 4 out of many more, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino (magnificent performances), Robert Duvall (Perfect), Talia Shire (extremely good). Please take the time to watch this movie, it's worth it.\n",

            "Review 280: Now I love movies in general, but somehow the so-called masterpiece \"The Godfather\" from 1972 has not appealed to me enough to sit through the darkly-lit, three-hour running time. However, I hear great things about \"The Offer\" which is about the making of \"The Godfather,\" so I decide to invest ten minutes of my time to see what this series is about. It is indeed a well-made show, with a good story, and I end up watching all episodes. So now in 2023 I just have to watch \"The Godfather.\" I can see why this movie would be considered a classic for its time. It has interesting, brooding shots, cast with powerhouse actors, some not yet famous at the time but have since become huge celebrities in their own right. I do have issues with the movie's slow pace, some campy acting from supporting actors, like a couple of mafia sidekicks and the father of the bride in Sicily, awkward fade transitions between scenes, and some rather disjointed turn of events. But all of that is forgiven now that I have discovered the gem that is Al Pacino. I have watched a few of his later movies when he is already considered a legendary actor, but nothing has tickled my fancy until seeing him as a young, very handsome Pacino in \"The Godfather,\" who can convey a million emotions just from his piercing thoughtful gaze. \"The Offer\" is correct; you cannot take your eyes off Pacino as Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather,\" even as you witness his gradual moral deterioration. For this, I give this \"classic\" 8 stars in 2023.\n",

            "Review 281: \"The Godfather\" - 3 Oscars, including for the Best film, the cast, which became legendary, the images imitated by followers. This film marked an entire era of gangster cinema fashion.Francis Ford Coppola's film lasts almost 3 hours. Yes, it is long, in places it seems that it is drawn out, but this is due to the fact that the film was released more than 45 years ago. Then it was not fashionable and necessary to show constant action on the screen, the scenes were long. However, this, in my opinion, helped to show the life of the main characters more detailed, to feel their characters, to better understand their motivation.There are two key figures in the film. And they are played by iconic actors. Marlon Brando masterfully tries on the mantle of the main mafia, who enjoys indisputable authority. This is felt in every frame, in every scene where there is a hero Don Vito Corleone. He solves issues, gives advice, is responsible for the whole family. Brando manages this image very well, you believe him, you associate him with Don Corleone for a long time.Al Pacino plays Brando's son named Michael. And from the very first frames you realize that he chose a different fate. He's going the other way. A valiant soldier, a loyal son whose fate turns out to be different than he planned. And the character changes throughout the film. Coppola demonstrates this perfectly, and Pacino helps him by revealing himself in every scene. This is a wonderful work of an actor who got used to the role.The rest of the cast is decent, but they all take their place in the picture, allowing Brando and Pacino to be the center of attention.The painting perfectly conveys the spirit of the time. Gang wars, underground business, family troubles, death. All this is closely intertwined with the plot, perfectly placed in the frame, immersing the viewer in the atmosphere of an action movie.I like the picture. There are no beautifully staged shootouts, fights, which is typical for today's Hollywood. This movie is a classic. The colors are faded, the deaths of people look much more realistic. It's as if you understand that this is not a movie, but the decisive truth, if you find yourself in that terrible world. After all, the mafia and its wars are not the beauty that you expect to see, even if it is gangster. This is a horror that you should not get into, because the result is likely to be death: yours and your loved ones. Is it necessary?The soundtrack is also beautiful. The main musical theme is recognized always and everywhere and does not age even after almost 50 years. This is the test of time.Coppola's film is ultimatum, beautiful and cruel at the same time, it shows the world of gangsters without embellishment, makes you think about the terrible times of gang wars. But he also makes it clear that the family is a very important place, so to speak. A family is a home, it is a motivator, it is a fortress in which there are necessarily difficult milestones.Coppola's work is an excellent film adaptation of Puzo's book, which is a must-see for everyone in due time. Classics are immortal.10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 283: The Godfather is a film that can be easily described not as a gangster flick, but more like an opera.  We see the struggle of one family trying to run the business in a world where rival families will do anything to muscle them out of the way.  Al Pacino is the doomed Michael who will one day take over the family business.  Try as he might to avoid it, it is his destiny. The cast is outstanding, the script is top notch and what other film could spend the entire first forty minutes at a wedding?  Watch this with the equally great Godfather Part II and the follow up Godfather III.  Some will say that Godfather III is the weakest one of them all.  I say it is a perfect ending to an opera of one of the greatest gangster sagas of all time.\n",

It's really a great story about the shedding of ideals in favor of supporting the corrupt criminal gang that is Michael Corleone's (Pacino) family. So many classic quotes and movie scenes.

            "Review 286: Many men has called this the greatest movie ever made. I disagree, though I liked it very much. The hype of this movie is as interesting as the movie itself as it says a lot about the world we live in and the men who seek power. I have seen and read intimidation used by people, trying to personally attack any who called this movie terrible or boring calling them stupid, while many other just jumped on the wagon calling it the greatest movie ever made to avoid such attack. A similar pattern to how physically strong, but emotionally weak men like Capone and Hitler came to power.The movie is significant to both world and film history. I however only give the movie a 5 as by todays standard its less artistic, entertaining and original. I also did not feel there was much new or original to learn from this movie and I did not get that \"wow\" feeling. I would not have much interest to see it again.This is one of my favorite gangster movies though and its certainly not terrible or boring. However it lacks in much of what I think a great movie should be such as: Moral points, emotion, surprise, humor, editing, cinematography, original thought, special effects, music score or even acting.(the tough guy role is not as challenging as it is to play mentally ill person) It does also not appeal to a very broad audience (not a movie many women and children like). It was great for its time, but compared to some of todays movies is very limited in the areas of greatness.If you like movies like old gangster movies or even tough guy movies like \"the departed\" and \"scarface\" or want to know what the hype is about. I recommend this movie it is a great movie for this genre. But it does not reach the emotional or theatrical heights of movies like \"Forrest Gump\", \"the Lord of the Rings\", \"Dances with Wolves\" or even my favorite gangster movie \"Goodfellas\".\n",

            "Review 288: Black screen. Cue the lone trumpet's haunting opening notes of Nino Rota's theme. Close up of a suffering man. \"I believe in America.\" That, my friends, is a powerful opening to a truly great film.It's been 40 years since it's original release, and this latest remastering looked and sounded amazing on Cinemark's largest screen. Following those opening moments, we get our first look at Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone. On this screen, it was almost like seeing him for the first time ... a disquieting figure that oozes power and demands respect.There is no need for another review of this truly classic American film. Instead, this will offer a few observations (possible spoilers) and notes of interest ... combined with the highest possible recommendation to watch this one again!At its core, author Mario Puzo's story is about power, loyalty, trust and family. We witness what happens when one is viewed as having too much power. Loyalty is rewarded, and disloyalty brings the harshest possible penalty. Trust is gained over time, but lost in a flash. And family is the most complex subject of all.Over the years, there have been a few movies with more star-studded casts, but it's difficult to imagine a more perfectly selected cast: Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Richard Conte, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda. Each of these actors have graced the screen in numerous roles, but for this three hour film, they become Corleones, associates, enemies, etc. There were a few things that jumped out at me during this viewing. The use of oranges (the fruit) contradicts the health benefits preached by the medical profession. Every time we see a bowl of fruit, a fruit stand or someone peeling, eating, or selecting an orange, a scene of doom (usually quite violent) is soon to follow. Carlo is even wearing an orange suit when Sonny (James Caan) shows up and paints the sidewalk with him. Don't miss the billboard featuring oranges that Sonny drives by just before he pulls up to the toll booth. Brando's final scene is preceded by him playfully scaring his grandson with an orange peel. I understand the importance of Vitamin C, but I think I'll stick with supplements!It's very interesting to note the camera angles throughout the movie. In an unusual approach, director Francis Ford Coppola uses an \"eye-level\" camera almost exclusively. This gives the viewer the feeling of being part of the scene, especially during the small group meetings within Corleone's dimly lit office. The few exceptions are the overhead shot of Corleone being shot, the Los Angeles cityscape, and a couple of shots at the wedding to emphasize the scale of the event.The famous \"Mattress Sequence\" was put together by George Lucas (Star Wars fame) for his friend Coppola. This is the segment after the Louis Restaurant shooting where we get a montage of B&W crime photos and newspaper headlines. These are real life crime photos and one of the shots is of Frank Nitti, Al Capone's trusted enforcer.It's quite fascinating to recognize how many \"classic\" lines of dialogue sprung from the movie, especially when you notice the minimalistic approach to dialogue used by Puzo and Coppola. Much of the communication is non-verbal body language, glances, nods and shrugs ... Brando, especially, is a master at this.One of the more remarkable facets of the film is the transformation of Michael (Al Pacino). We first see him as a dashing war hero relaxing at the wedding with his girlfriend (a baby-faced Diane Keaton). He is very laid back and kind of cocky with the thought that he can rise above the dirty family business. He sees himself as better than that. Watch the subtle changes in his appearance ... his hair, his posture, his eyes, even his hat! As great as Brando is as the Don, it's Pacino's performance that really takes the film to an unprecedented level. It's really fun to compare Michael's even-keeled, calm processing approach to the high-strung, act-now-think-later approach of his brother Sonny.The final note involves actor John Cazale. Here (and in part 2) he plays Fredo as a frightened, insecure puppy who is desperate to find his place. Imagine your father being Vito Corleone and your brothers are Sonny and Michael. It's to be expected that you might be overlooked and overpowered in conversation. The really interesting note about Cazale is that this was his feature film debut. He went on to make 4 more films before cancer took his life in 1978. Cazale made 5 films and all 5 were nominated for Best Picture (both Godfather films, The Conversation, Dog Day Afternoon, The Deer Hunter). He was engaged to Meryl Streep at the time of his death.So the real point here is that if you ever doubt the magic and power of movies ... shut off your phone, close the blinds, take the cannoli, and let The Godfather absorb your thoughts. While you are at it, remember ... it's not personal, it's business (only you shouldn't really believe that).Thanks to Cinemark for making me an offer I couldn't refuse.\n",

            "Review 289: The 70s is my favourite decade of films, a new breed of cinema began and it started with The Godfather and ended with Apocalypse Now, both directed by the master, Coppolla!!! In-between, we had many films, ranging from innovative thrillers to a stunning comic book picture(Superman), from horrors to romance etc etc.Guys and gals, the 1970s was and always will be the decade when cinema had taken a massive change. Don't get me wrong, I love the 40s, 50s, 60s, 80s and 90s, but the decade in question just took a bigger step.The Godfather is storytelling at its finest, it just can't get any better (actually it does in Godfather part2), this film is stunning, amazing, breathtaking and near-perfection.The performances are stunning, every person in the picture is amazing, they really drew me into their world. Marlon Brando is amazing, no one could've made this role work. On paper, Brando's role is simple but the execution could only be done by Marlon.The masterful story-telling crafted by Mario Puzo and Francis Coppolla hit the right notes. Francis directs each scene with stunning authority. The production values are breathtaking, very authentic. Every person on the film deserves a hand. And let's not forget the unforgettable score by Nina Rota.I won't tell you about the story because only the film can do it justice. Just watch it. Always worth watching every year, a film which will take multiple viewings to understand all characters.The saga continues in The Godfather part 2.This is A MASTERPIECE!\n",

As (almost) always, the book is better than the movie.  Please do yourself a favor and pick up a copy somewhere, and if you aren't \"hooked\" by the second or third page I would be amazed.One advantage of the book is it goes into much richer and more vivid detail than the film does (a lot of material from the book was used in the subsequent Godfather movies as well -- there's no way a single movie could ever capture that much detail).  It's a delightful and utterly satisfying tapestry.  If it sounds like I'm reviewing the book more than the movie, it's probably because it's a long time since I've seen the film -- but I re-read the book often because it's a work of literary genius and by far the finest work of fiction ever written on this subject.

            "Review 302: The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn \"Godfather\", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed.\n",

            "Review 306: The Godfather in one word...Perfect. This film has some of the best scenes I've seen all my life. The script is superb and the director is one of the best in the business. The actors were great and all played a vital role in this masterpiece. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino have possibly given their best performances in this film than any other they have starred in. Some people might not like this film because it's too long but I think that's sad. People like them should absolutely give this film a chance and if they still don't like it then there is something completely wrong with their taste in movies. Overall, The Godfather is an outstanding achievement of Hollywood cinema and it delivers on ALL accounts. There is nothing bad I have to say about this film. It is literally perfect.I give The Godfather a perfect: 5/5 or 10/10\n",

            "Review 307: Heady, scalding adaptation of Mario Puzo's bestselling book about Italian Mafia family as seen through many years time. Flawless production design and palpably tense, prickly atmosphere are two of the picture's many riches, and indeed Marlon Brando's performance as the family patriarch is an incredible characterization, though several of the other characters don't always come off and the repellent violence is occasionally presented in a ham-fisted manner (with too much wicked glee behind the bloodshed). Francis Ford Coppola directed the proceedings like someone who has lived and breathed this material, and he doesn't allow his love for movie-making magic to cloud the realism of this family's dark dealings, but he perhaps allowed the cast too much free reign and some sequences tend to ramble. Won Oscars for Brando as Best Actor (he refused it), Coppola and Mario Puzo for their adapted screenplay and for Best Picture. Followed by two Coppola-directed sequels in 1974 and 1990. *** from ****\n",

            "Review 309: The Godfather is the ultimate example of how to adapt a book into a film. Mario Puzo's novel was extremely readable, but didn't seem to lend itself to cinema. It consisted of a whole slew of sub-books, each about a different character, each totally different in feel, each containing pages and pages of backstory and history. Add to this a high quotient of sex and violence, and only the fact that it was selling copiously convinced studio executives to touch it with a ten-foot pole.It's a good thing they did, because I don't know of any other case where so much has come from so little. Everybody is perfectly cast, from Brando down the the most minute walk-on. No punches are pulled with bringing the book's content to the screen, the production design creates a perfect-looking world for it to take place in, the cinematography captures that world beautifully, and the score emotionally underscores it all magnificently.This truly is one of the medium's pillars.\n",

            "Review 310: In the spring of 1968, Paramount Pictures bought Mario Puzo's novel treatment \"The Godfather\" for $12,500 against $75,000 if it became a finished book. When filming of it began three years later, the relatively unknown Francis Ford Coppola was hired to direct. Coppola had just made the box-office failure \"The Rain People\", so Paramount counted on him to be malleable and work for a fairly low salary.The movie opens in New York City in the late 1940s. The youngest son of a powerful Mafia boss returns from service in the war to find himself slowly being drawn into the family's brutal business.Unfortunately Coppola and Paramount fell out with each other immediately. The director wanted Marlon Brando as the Mafia boss, but the movie company firmly opposed that choice. They meant that the actor was hopelessly passé and that he also was extremely difficult to work with. But, after being threatened with dismissal several times, Coppola finally got his way and was able to hire Brando.The row flared up again when Coppola explained that he intended to travel to Sicily to shoot the scenes where Michael Corleone is in Italy. Paramount Pictures responded by contacting veteran director Elia Kazan, asking him to take over the film. The situation didn't calm down until Coppola showed the executives at Paramount some of his beautiful and exciting rushes from the Mediterranean island.The movie opened in five theaters in the New York area before moving to over 300 theaters nationwide. And it was breaking records everywhere. Later the same year the film overtook the previous all-time box office champion, \"Gone With the Wind\". In 1998, the American Film Institute then named \"The Godfather\" one of the greatest American movies ever made, testifying to its enduring artistic legacy. Francis Ford Coppola's triumph was complete.\n",

            "Review 315: Chances are you may have heard of this film, then again maybe you haven't. Anyway, let's cut to the chase. 'The Godfather', running at just under three hours, boasts at least four set pieces which will have you at the edge of your seat. The director takes care in familiarising us with not just the Corleone family, but also their staff and associates, which really engages the viewer. We are also witness to the transformation of a certain Michael Corleone. There are elements of tragedy in this film which sows the seeds for future perpetrations of revenge, and the ultimate message that I took away was that man has the capacity to cause absolute carnage, which clearly we already know: I suppose that it does no little harm to remind ourselves of that fact. In terms of the acting, it superlative with everyone putting in credible performances. Given that the director was under incredible pressure to make this a success, it is a fantastic feat and still holds up today as the definitive mob movie. However, let me put all that to one side and reserve special credit to Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola who have created quite possibly the best and most recognisable soundtrack in movie history. If you don't already have it, I recommend that you buy 'The Godfather Trilogy' album: there are songs on the album which, if they don't send a shiver up your spine, will reduce you to tears, such is the poignancy of these compositions. I strongly believe that this film would not have been what it is without this soundtrack - it is that crucial to the overall structure.\n",

First we see the development of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino, his character is given a great arc in the film and you really get to see the impact that the life of crime has on a person. The second key story is essentially the rest of the Corleone family. Sure we get certain subplots involving different members of the family, but it all is really used to show this life of crime.If you are someone that has been raised on fast paced blockbusters I suggest you steer clear of this film because you will find it very slow. But if you are someone that loves movies that dive into and explore a character and certain themes, this film is for you. The film does a phenomenal job of having a really straightforward story. We first get introduced to the characters and get a good sense of what makes them tick. As the story progresses it sets up different plot points and conflicts that leave you guessing what exactly is going to happen. These plot points and conflicts are constantly being developed and resolved throughout the film, and when you get to the end it leaves you with a very satisfying conclusion that wraps everything up perfectly.Overall this is a phenomenal film. The amazing construction of the story paired with an insanely talented cast will please any movie lover.10/10.\n",

Indelible scenes need only a word or two to ignite the memory: the baptism, the horse head, Sonny's fate, the restaurant murder, and the list goes on.  Brando and Pacino are fantastic, but I love to praise the work of James Caan and Robert Duvall.  Their roles might be smaller, but I couldn't imagine the film without them.  The fury with which Sonny unleashes the brutal beatdown of Carlo is palpable, and I adore the brilliant impartiality and distance kept by the camera (it seems to hover in medium shot just far enough to keep the children playing in the opened hydrant in frame during the course of the pounding) as well as the other onlookers who know better than to get in the middle.\n",

People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather.

            "Review 327: THE GODFATHER was a worldwide box office smash and cultural phenomenon ever since its release in the spring of 1972. The saga of Don Vito Corleone and his family\n",
            "~and \"the Family\"~ has become so entrenched in the public consciousness that it wouldn't be hyperbolic to compare it to Shakespeare. And like the Bard's works, THE GODFATHER will endure for many more decades, if not centuries. Between the vivid set pieces, quotable catchphrases, and Nino Rota's memorable score, THE GODFATHER has maybe two or three competitors for the title of greatest of all time.Mario Puzo's bestseller attracted Hollywood's attention while it was still in the publication stage. After Paramount optioned the movie rights, Robert Evans, the dynamic vice president in charge of production, believed that its story of the Mafia's inner world would best be served if directed by someone of Italian descent. Spaghetti Western maestro Sergio Leone was among those offered, but he declined to concentrate on his own gangster picture, which would eventually become ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.Several other directors turned Evans and Paramount down before they settled on 32 year old Francis Ford Coppola, best known for getting his start working for Roger Corman. Paramount's rationale behind picking Coppola was that because he hadn't yet had a hit on his hands, he'd be a lot easier to control. It would be a major miscalculation!!From the beginning, Coppola and Paramount butted heads over just about everything starting with the casting. The studio wanted Laurence Olivier in the role of Vito Corleone, yet Coppola could see no one else but Marlon Brando in the iconic part. However, the notoriously difficult Brando had generated so much bad will in Hollywood for the last fifteen years that Paramount refused to even consider him. After much haggling, the studio capitulated only under the stipulation that the actor sign a waiver stating that any cost overruns due to his behavior would be reimbursed by him.Coppola encountered just as much opposition from the front office over who would play Michael Corleone. He wanted Al Pacino, a New York Method actor whose movie debut didn't win executives over. Paramount much preferred marquee names such as Dustin Hoffman or Warren Beatty; they even considered an unknown by the name of Robert DeNiro ~more about him in the sequel.The director's headaches didn't end with the casting. He battled constantly with the front office over just about everything. They preferred that THE GODFATHER be shot on the Paramount lots and backlots, but Coppola insisted on filming on location in New York and Sicily. He went over budget and schedule, but that wasn't uncommon for a big picture in those days. Nevertheless, Coppola was certain of being fired, and it's possible that the only reason they didn't was because it would be too expensive to change horses in midstream (metaphorically speaking).For the benefit of the half dozen people not familiar with THE GODFATHER, the year is 1945 and Vito Corleone is the most powerful Mafia don in New York. Using his Genco olive oil import business as a legitimate front, his influence is so far reaching he has politicians, newspapermen, and judges on his payroll. Much like any Shakespearean monarch, Vito has four sons: the eldest and heir apparent is the philandering and hot-headed Santino \"Sonny\" (played by James Caan). Next in line is weak minded Fredo (John Cazale, followed by honest, upstanding Michael, a decorated Marine recently returned from the war. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) isn't actually a biological offspring, but was adopted as a child by Vito, and is presently the family lawyer and consigliere.The movie's first half hour takes place at Vito's Long Island estate where his only daughter Connie has just been married. Alternating business with pleasure receiving guests in his study. According to Sicilian custom, no man can turn down a request on his daughter's wedding day, and among the visitors he receives is godson Johnny Fontane, a has-been crooned obviously patterned after Frank Sinatra.A vindictive movie mogul, Jack Woltz, is denying Johnny a crucial role in a picture that could recharge his sagging career. Tom is dispatched to Hollywood to make the producer an offer he can't refuse, which is exactly what the beligerent Woltz foolishly does before ordering Hagen off his premises. The next morning, he awakens to discover that something unpleasant has been left underneath his bedsheets, provoking a sudden, cooperative change of heart.Back in New York, the Godfather grants an audience to Virgil Sollozzo, a narcotics gangster seeking investment and protection that only someone like Vito Corleone can provide. After diplomatically turning him down, an attempt is made on Vito's life which changes the Corleone dynamic, as Sonny undertakes the reins until his father is well enough to retake power. Michael, considered the white sheep of the family, now begins to take an active role in the business.One of the most seminal moments in a movie full of them is when Sonny, Tom, Michael, and two Corleone capos are discussing what to do about Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain serving as his bodyguard. Coppola brilliantly ~and inconspicuously~ focuses the camera in a slow close-up of Michael as he proposes killing both of them. It perfectly encapsulates the transformation from good to evil.After the foul deed is done, Michael flees to Sicily under the protection of Don Tomassini, Vito's olive oil exporter. Despite the fact that he left behind a fiancee in New York, Michael weds a local Sicilian girl/woman while, back in America, enemies of the Corleones seek to exploit Sonny's volcanic temper. Though he never fully regains his health, Vito summons enough strength to broker a truce with the other family heads and arrange to bring his exiled son home safely to eventually take over.THE GODFATHER forever changed the lives of everyone involved. Brando, whose career was briefly resurrected, won his second Academy Award but didn't bother to take advantage of it, making only four pictures in the decade- the last two were little more than cameo appearances. Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton sustained long lasting careers, but even they will forever be identified with these roles.Aside from Coppola and Nino Rota, the one person behind the scenes whose unsung contributions was indispensable was cinematographer Gordon Willis. Nicknamed the Prince of Darkness for illuminating dark atmospheres, Willis was a genius who proved it was possible to utilize the German Expressionist method of shadow and light, and apply it to color celluloid. His bright photography of Sicily's rugged outdoors, accomplished with yellow filters, was clearly an homage to Visconti's THE LEOPARD.THE GODFATHER dethroned THE SOUND OF MUSIC as the all-time box office champion. As hard as this is to believe, it only captured three Oscars that year: Picture, Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay. Coppola's direction certainly should have been rewarded, but at least the Academy Awards committee atoned for that slight two years later when the sequel took home twice the amount of hardware.THE GODFATHER is an absolute must-have in any movie lover's library. 🔚\n",

Not only because of the very good and epic story (Mario Puzo), but also because of the aesthetics and fabulous cinematography by Gordon Willis (Annie Hall, Klute). Not to mention the absolutely fantastic cast. It's is impressive that Marlon Brando played the completely different part he did the same year in Bertolucci's 'Ultimo tango a Parigi'. I think it is a pity Sterling Hayden (The Killing, Dr. Strangelove, Asphalt Jungle) had such small part in this nine-hour trilogy.One of the most distinctive elements of this great crime movie is the music, which was already recognizable in 'Rocco e i suoi fratelli' (Visconti, 1960) and was more or less recycled for this film by Nino Rota (Amarcord, Obsession, Boccaccio '70).10 points out of 10 :-)\n",

Marlon Brando (in his Oscar winning role) as Vito leads a powerful cast, who all do superbly in their roles. Al Pacino and James Cann provide excellent support as two of Vito's sons, and honorable mentions are Sterling Hayden and Robert Duvall. Francis Ford Coppola's powerful direction really flushes out everything in this film. Instead of telling the viewer what to feel about the characters, he lets them rather get involved in the storyline. The script too is amazing, detailing very particular things about the life of the Mafia, and also showing how corruption can even get to the nicest of people. The photography is very 70's style and shows the era the film takes place in very well. It's also noteworthy that this film started about every cliche in mafia films today. Whether it is lines such as \"Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.\" or just the assassination scenes, it all came from this film. It's a startling and bold achievment in filmaking, but Coppola could have also made the connections between certain characters a bit more apparent. Best film of all time?

Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named \"The Best Movie of All Time.\"\n",

            "Review 331: The Godfather is the greatest film of all time. Films like The Godfather are the reason i have a passion and love for film. In few movies can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one.If The Godfather was only about gun Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. Every major character,and more than a few minor ones is molded into a distinct, complex individual.The film Begins in the study of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the Godfather, who is holding court. It is the wedding of his daughter Connie (Talia Shire), and no Sicilian can refuse a request on that day. So the supplicants come, each wanting something different - revenge, a husband for their daughter, a part in a movie.The family has gathered for the event. Michael (Al Pacino), Don Vito's youngest son and a second world war hero, is back home in the company of a new girlfriend (Diane Keaton). The two older boys, Sonny (James Caan) and Fredo (John Cazale), are there as well, along with their \"adopted\" brother, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), the don's right-hand man.With the end of the war, the times are changing, and as much as Don Vito seems in control at the wedding, his power is beginning to erode. By the standards of some, his views on the importance of family, loyalty, and respect are antiquated. Even his heir apparent, Sonny, disagrees with his refusal to get into the drug business. Gambling and alcohol are forces of the past and present; narcotics are the future. But Don Vito will not compromise, even when a powerful drug supplier named Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) arrives with promises of high profits for those who back him.Don Vito's refusal to do business with Sollozzo strikes the first sparks of a war that will last for years and cost many lives. Each of the five major mob families in New York will be gouged by the bloodshed, and a new order will emerge. Betrayals will take place, and the Corleone family will be shaken to its roots by treachery from both within and without.The Corleone with the most screen time is Michael (it's therefore odd that Al Pacino received a Best Supporting Actor nomination), and his tale, because of its scope and breadth, is marginally dominant. His transformation from \"innocent\" bystander to central manipulator is the stuff of a Shakespearean tragedy. By the end, this man who claimed to be different from the rest of his family has become more ruthless than Don Vito ever was.Next to Humphrey Bogart's Rick from Casablanca, Oscar winner Marlon Brando's Don Vito may be the most imitated character in screen history. The line \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" has attained legendary status, as has the entire performance. With his raspy voice, deliberate movements, and penetrating stare, Brando has created a personae that will be recalled for as long as motion pictures exist.Don Vito is a most complicated gangster. In his own words, he is not a killer, and he never mixes business with personal matters. He puts family first (\"A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man\") and despises displays of weakness. He understands the burden of power, and his wordless sympathy for Michael when he is forced to assume the \"throne\", is one of The Godfather's most revealing moments (about both father and son).The Godfather had three Best Supporting Actor nominees, all well-deserved. The first was Pacino (who probably should have been nominated alongside Brando in the Best Actor category). The other two were James Caan and Robert Duvall. In a way, it's surprising that Duvall wasn't passed over. His presence in The Godfather isn't flashy or attention-arresting. Like his character of Tom Hagen, he is steady, reliable, and stays in the background. Not so for Caan's Sonny, whose demonstrative and volatile personality can't be overlooked.Family responsibility. A father's legacy. The need to earn respect. The corrupting influence of power. These are some of the ingredients combined in Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic blender. They are themes which have intrigued the greatest authors of every medium through the centuries.Although the issues presented in The Godfather are universal in scope, the characters and setting are decidedly ethnic. Even to this day, there is an odd romanticism associated with New York's Italian crime families. The word \"Mafia\" conjures up images of the sinister and mysterious - scenes of the sort where Luca Brasi meets his fate. Francis Ford Coppola has tapped into this fascination and woven it as yet another element of the many that make his motion picture a compelling experience.\n",

            "Review 332: The film is one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment. When, after ruling for two generations, the Mafia's New York Don (Marlon Brando) dies, his youngest son (Al Pacino) takes over reluctantly, but later learns the ruthlessness and brutality required to maintain his position.The Godfather is a brilliantly-made film with all the fascination of a snake pit: a warm-hearted family saga except that the members are thieves and murderers. Its position as one of the great films of the last century is secure, in part because it works on so many levels: as a father-and-son story, as an epic account of the Mob's overt power and clandestine business empires in America; and as an apparently authentic glimpse into a closed world, with its own distinct and deadly codes of behaviour.\n",

            "Review 333: It's a difficult word to cope with. It's a word that I try to toss around as little as possible. But there's just no other word. The Godfather isn't necessarily my favorite film of all time, it's not necessarily the best film of all time, but it's just that: perfect.Very few films can make this claim; very few films work on every possible level, on every aspect of the art of cinema, with every line and every shot perfectly placed, none wasted, none too fast, none too slow. The Godfather is a film that takes its time, sometimes moving slowly, but never so slowly that it loses momentum; it's a film that's incredibly rich and full of emotion and symbolism, but it's also very entertaining.In the music - Nino Rota's score compliments every scene its in, immerses the viewer, never distracting but always a part of the atmosphere, so that whenever you'll hear it a scene from the film will immediately come to mind.In the editing - it can be very simple at times, and very intense at others - like the baptism scene near the end. It can be slow and tense, it can be calm and euphoric, and it can also be bloody violent.In the cinematography - the lighting is never coincidental, always complimenting the mood of the scene, the coloring always expressive and always of importance.In the acting, of course - The Godfather boasts a supergroup of actors, and almost all of them pull their most impressive performance here - Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton... this is to the credit of Francis Ford Coppola who drove the actors to these performances as much as the actors themselves.There is no film better than The Godfather. There may be films that are more complex, more original - The Godfather's tale, beneath the complexity of dozens of characters, is a simple story of family, honesty, morality, loyalty and family... most of all family. Even Part II can be seen as more sophisticated than the first film - but it's not 'better', because unlike The Godfather, Part II has flaws, small as they may be.If you love movies - watch The Godfather. Whether or not you're interested in crime fiction, watch it. If you just want a good piece of entertainment, watch it too. It's a rare accomplishment - it's a film of quality that may be equaled, but can never be surpassed.\n",

            "Cast - Al Pacino, Marlon BrandoIt is the highest-rated movie of all time. I found it realistic about underworld life. I have never seen any movie adapted from a very linear simple story but picturized with an awesome screenplay. The acting of every male character in this movie was top notch though all the female characters were more than dull. I liked the patience and planning of a godfather and how he deals with his enemies. There were some heavy dialogues delivered perfectly.However, I did not like the story that much. It is more than good according to the year of its publication. But still, there is nothing to learn from this movie. This movie is enjoyable at the same time boring. The story is also predictable and there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie. I will recommend this movie as maybe this movie does not reside with my taste but others may like it so much. Finally, I found it overhyped and overrated.Personal Rating - 6.5/10\n",

It's a character driven film more than a plot driven film that's why we feel unsettling while watching the first 1 hour but as long as you travel with the characters and their emotions you can feel the magic. Can't thank enough the cast and crew for this greatest cinematic experience, I wish every movie buff will check out this film to witness how a grand masterpiece can influence their work.\n",

            "Review 337: One of the most critically acclaimed films in all of history, The Godfather shows us inside the world of the mob. But not in a usual way. The main character Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the crime lord of the biggest crime family in Ney York, but the film portrays him as an honorable person. He never really does anything that we can look down on him for. He has a strict moral code and always spends him free time with his family. He is an elderly man who has 3 sons and 1 daughter. Michael Corleone (Al Pachino) wants nothing to do with the crime family, Sonny Corleone (James Caan) is a hothead, Fredo Corleone (John Cazale) is a weakling, and Connie Corleone (Talia Shire) is Vito's only daughter. The story really begins when Vito refuses the request of local drug lord Virgil Sollozo (Al Lettieri) and as a result, Sollozo attempts to kill Vito. With Vito in the hospital Captain Mark McCluskey (Sterling Hayden) a corrupt police officer working for Sollozo arrests all of Vito's bodyguards leaving Vito unprotected. With Sonny as the acting don, Michael goes to visit Vito in the hospital but as he is leaving McCluskey shows up and attempts to arrest Michael but not before Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) the Corleone's lawyer shows up to save Michael. Later after convincing Sonny, Michael stages a meeting with Sollozo and McCluskey in a restaurant but in a life changing moment shoots them booth in the head. From that point on the film showcases the evolution of Michael from the college kid he was before now to a ruthless mobster. This film is one of the most celebrated and critically acclaimed in history, and it's easy to see why. The characters here are all great. The acting (which is important because that's what makes the memorable characters) is equally great. Brando in fact won an Oscar for his performance as Vito. If you ever come across this movie, stop and watch it.\n",

Within these films everything seems to come together so perfectly, ranging from the acting, to the writing, to the directing. The Godfather is one of those such films.The Godfather is one of the most endlessly entertaining films of all-time. Each and every time you watch the infamous hospital scene you can't help but get tense. When Michael goes to get the gun out of the toilet, your heart quickens. This all a testament to the film's magnificent director, Francis Ford Coppola. This is Coppola's finest work of his career. Though not only is the Godfather an entertaining film, but it is also the thought provoking character study of Michael Corleone, which is just one more reason as to why Coppola deserves recognition. Though Coppola's true merit as a director can be seen in the many magnificent performances within this film. The stellar cast ranging from Al Pacino to James Caan is awesome, though its Marlon Brando's iconic performance as the Godfather himself that steals the show.Overall the Godfather is easily one of the best films of all-time, and while it may not necessarily be my number one, it is awfully close.I give the Godfather a perfect 10 out of 10!\n",

This mob drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper into the family business.For this movie, I decided not to write a full review as everyone knows how good the Godfather is. It has been an inspiration for all movies that came out after it. The cinematography is amazing, the plot is very grasping, the acting is phenomenal, the script is very well written, the plot twist are so shocking , the three hours run time passes by so quickly, and I could keep going on and on however I would like you to go watch that movie and experience it on your own. You don't have to be a fan of gangster movies to likes this, so you just need to go watch it for yourself as soon as possible and enjoy this masterpiece.Score:9/10.\n",

            "Review 342: THE GODFATHER was a worldwide box office smash and cultural phenomenon ever since its release in 1972. The saga of Don Vito Corleone and his family -and his \"family\"- has become so firmly entrenched in the public consciousness that it wouldn't be hyperbolic to compare it to Shakespeare. And like the Bard's works, THE GODFATHER will endure for many more decades, if not centuries. Between the vivid set pieces, quotable catchphrases, and Nino Rota's memorable score, THE GODFATHER has maybe two or three competitors for the title of \"greatest of all time\".Mario Puzo's bestseller attracted Hollywood's attention while it was still in the publication stage. After Paramount optioned the movie rights, Robert Evans, the dynamic vice president in charge of production, believed that its story about the Mafia's inner world would best be served if directed by someone of Italian descent. Spaghetti Western maestro Sergio Leone was among those offered, but he declined to concentrate on his own gangster picture, which would eventually become ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA.After several others turned Evans and Paramount down, they settled on Francis Ford Coppola, a 32 year old best known for getting his start working for Roger Corman. Paramount's rationale for picking Coppola was that because he hadn't yet had a hit on his hands, he'd be lot easier to control. It would be a major miscalculation!From the beginning, Coppola and Paramount butted heads over just about everything, starting with the casting. The studio wanted Laurence Olivier in the role of Vito Corleone, yet Coppola could see no one else but Marlon Brando in the iconic part. But the notoriously difficult Brando had created so much bad will in Hollywood for the last fifteen years that Paramount refused to even consider him. After much haggling, the studio capitulated only under the condition that the actor sign a waiver stipulating that any cost overruns due to his behaviour would be reimbursed by him.Coppola encountered just as much opposition from the front office over who would play Michael Corleone. He wanted Al Pacino, a New York Method actor whose movie debut didn't win the executives over. Paramount preferred marquee names such as Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty; they even considered an unknown by the name of Robert DeNiro -more about him in the sequel.The director's headaches didn't end with the casting. He battled constantly with the front office over just about everything. They preferred that THE GODFATHER be shot on the studio lots and backlots, but Coppola insisted on filming on location in New York City and Sicily. He went over schedule and budget, but that was common those days for a big picture. Nevertheless, Coppola was certain of being fired, and it's possible the only reason they didn't was because it would be too expensive to change horses in midstream (metaphorically speaking).For the benefit of the five or six people who have not seen THE GODFATHER, the year is 1945 and Vito Corleone is the most powerful Mafia don in New York. Using his Genco olive oil import business as a legitimate front, his influence is so far reaching he has politicians, newspapermen, and judges on his payroll. Much like a Shakespearean monarch, Vito has four sons: the eldest and heir apparent is the philandering, hot-headed Santino (\"Sonny\"), played by James Caan. Next in line is weak minded Fredo (John Cazale), followed by honest, upstanding Michael (Al Pacino), a decorated Marine recently returned from the war. Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) isn't actually a biological offspring, but was adopted as child by Vito and is presently the family lawyer and consigliere.The movie's first half hour takes place at Vito's Long Island estate where his only daughter Connie gets married, alternating between business and pleasure as he receives guests in his study. According to Sicilian customer, no man can turn down a request on his daughter's wedding day, and among the visitors he receives is godson Johnny Fontane a has-been crooner obviously patterned after Frank Sinatra. A vindictive movie mogul, Jack Woltz, is denying Johnny a crucial role in a picture that will recharge his sagging career. Tom is dispatched to Hollywood to make Woltz an offer he can't refuse, which is exactly what the belligerent Woltz does before ordering Hagen off his premises. The next morning, the producer awakens to discover that something unpleasant has been left underneath his bedsheets, provoking a sudden, co-operative change of heart.Back in New York, the Godfather grants an audience to Virgil Sollozzo, a narcotics gangster seeking investment and protection that only someone like Vito Corleone can provide. After diplomatically turning him down, an attempt is made on Vito's life which changes the Corleone dynamic, as Sonny assumes the reins until his father is well enough to resume. Michael, considered the white sheep of the family, now begins to assume an active role in the business.One of the most seminal moments in a movie full of them is the scene where Sonny, Michael, Tom, and two Corleone capos are discussing what to do about Sollozzo and the corrupt police captain serving as his bodyguard. Coppola brilliantly -and slowly zooms the camera in closer to Michael as he proposes killing the both of them. It perfectly encapsulates the transformation from good to evil.After the foul deed is done, Michael flees to Sicily to hide under the guard of Don Tomassini, Vito's olive oil exporter. Despite the fact that he still has a fiancee back in America, Michael weds a local Sicilian girl who's barely a woman, while in America, enemies of the Corleone family seek to exploit Sonny's volcanic temper. Though the godfather never regains his health, Vito summons enough strength to broker a truce with the other families and make arrangements to bring Michael back unharmed to eventually take over the business.\n",

            "Review 345: Throughout history, well-intentioned men have committed many horrible crimes in the name of their mother countries.  THE GODFATHER is about a well-intentioned man named Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) who learns to commit horrible crimes in the name of his family.The Godfather is Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who heads one of the most powerful crime families in New York.  He has three sons: hot-tempered Santino (James Caan), weak-willed Fredo (John Cazale), and Michael. \"Michael,\" significantly, is the only Anglicized name of the three.  Michael is the only son who fought for the Americans in World War II, and the only one who wants nothing to do with the family crime business.  He is something of an outsider to his family.But Michael is devoted to his father.  And when Vito is severely wounded in an attempted assassination by drug dealer Virgil \"the Turk\" Sollozzo, who thinks Vito's heir apparent Santino will be readier to deal with him, then Michael saves his life.  Later, Michael murders the Turk and his hired police bodyguard, knowing that he will have to flee to Sicily for breaking the unwritten truce between the police and the Mafia.The saga of Michael's rise to head the Corleone family is one of the most fascinating stories ever told on screen.  It is hard to tell a good story about evil, but Coppola succeeds, principally because he shows the sincere devotion to family that lies behind the characters' deeds.  Michael is slowly corrupted into a cold-hearted killer, not by laziness or indifference or any other vice, but by his defining virtue: his love for his father and brothers!  Likewise, Santino comes to grief as a direct result of his only redeeming feature, his devotion to his sister.  This tragic irony suffuses the film.  The viewer thus can forgive the characters somewhat for their crimes, because the life they have been born into gives them a choice between violent crime and abandoning their loved ones.Nino Rota's sad, haunting score is superb, and his Siciliana theme is beautiful and tender.  The supporting performances are superb, particularly Abe Vigoda and Richard Castellano as the Godfather's tough but genial caporegimes, Robert Duvall as the \"consigliere\" or Mafia lawyer, and Al Lettieri as Sollozzo.  Luca Brasi unfortunately disappears too quickly; his role was more fleshed out in Puzo's original novel.Enter a world where murder is \"not personal.  It's strictly business.\"  You will never forget it.Rating: **** out of ****.\n",

I now realize that most of them are undoubtedly beautiful stories. Haven't read yet prior to the film Mario Puzo's novel, I pulled my guts to watch the film and did my best to understand the story as much as I do with other good-storied films. Godfather 1 had indeed made me witness another beautiful story of different origin. I never imagined how many beautiful stories would still be lingering out there, of every nature, of any environment or of any country it originates. Watching the film, starts with Marlon Brando playing the role of Don Vito Corleone, known as well as the \"Godfather\". I didn't quite understand really the way how crime worlds work, but to me I get the opportunity to understand dealing business with wits and cunning as how you deal practically with your teacher in school. The situation is different, but manner of dealing them is nonetheless similar. I appreciated well the film for Italian's value of family, relationship and trust. How Don Vito Corleone manage to deal business mixing trust and respect differently. How he mends and considers things equally and with weight. This is the first time I observed for the first time Al Pacino grasping a character filled with composure and serenity, and maintained such equanimity after tides turned inevitable to him in the story. I had to admit it is one of the excellent films I've watch so far. The characters, the setting, the environment, the story itself is so genuine and good that you couldn't deny it as a considerably first-rate film.\n",

            "Review 349: The people who vote on the Internet Movie Database have ranked \"The Godfather\" as the greatest film ever in human history. Which is nothing to sneeze at, and deserves some seriously thought. I watched the film, thought it was great, but hardly found it to be the greatest film ever made. I mean, if you told me \"Citizen Kane\" was the greatest film ever made, I would wholeheartedly agree. And personally, as far as gangster movies go -- with or without Al Pacino -- I think the real choice should be \"Scarface\". But I'm not professionally trained as a movie critic, so maybe I'm missing something.I asked my supervisor and a co-worker about the film, and while they both thought the film was good, they really did not think it was some amazing masterpiece. My supervisor said, \"maybe it's good because it is so real\", but that's not a convincing reason and how \"real\" it is I cannot say for sure.If nothing else, the film might be great simply because it has become so cliché. The horse head, the Marlon Brando voice, the gun behind the toilet and the line \"an offer he can't refuse\" are all part of pop culture these days (over 30 years later). But does being cliché make the film great? I guess that would make \"Star Wars\" the greatest film ever made, which is certainly not true (though not a bad film by any means).And sure, you have powerful and memorable performances. James Caan is amazing, Marlon Brando is a bit over-the-top (a mumbling, lock-jawed godfather? sure...). And Al Pacino is of course great as always, maybe more so here than anywhere else. Not only does he have more range here than any other film than \"Scent of a Woman\" (more often than not he simply repeats a variation of his Michael Corleone role), but he is so young and plain that he is not even recognizable as Al Pacino in many scenes (I didn't recognize him until 30 minutes into the picture).I haven't yet mentioned the plot: an aging mafia boss (Marlon Brando) hands control over to his son (Al Pacino) when the father becomes ill, though he hoped never to do so since his son is Ivy League educated. Brando's role is actually quite small compared to the attention he is given (the film is really about Pacino coming of age).The directing is decent. Nothing special, but not awful, either. Very real and almost gritty (but not dark). The acting is great. The music is perfect. The only thing that really needed work was the fact that many of the Italian scenes had no subtitles and were thus lost in (lack of) translation. The entire Sciliy subplot and Appollonia were excellent and could not have been improved upon.I'm sure much more could have been said, but I'll cut myself off here. Certainly looking forward to Part II (though keeping my hopes and expectations low) and maybe someday I'll see Part III (though I've been warned not to).\n",

Francis Ford Coppola's brilliant direction enhances performances from such top-quality actors as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, and more.It is a violent, tense masterpiece, a movie in the small pantheon with \"Alexander\" and \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (as well as the remainder of its own trilogy) that can hold your attention for three or more hours and never skew boring. If you're still unsure, pay attention to the squibs. Or the brilliantly natural production design. Or Gordon Willis's imaginative cinematography.Still not convinced? Just listen to this: it's much better than the book. \"The Godfather,\" while very brutal, is probably the greatest American cinematic masterpiece.

The movie itself is a disjointed mess with nothing but boring chatter and hearsay scenes in-between shooting people up or beating people up. Sure the mafia was bad and terrorized people but this movie just basically makes it look like a pay us for protection racket type thug movie. Overrrated,badly acted and boring. I give it a big fat zero.\n",

            "Review 354: The Godfather is one of those movies that is good only for what it is. Some very dramatic moments, good dialog, some good romance, likable characters and a complete story. Its an overall very good film but not the most rewatchable in my opinion.\n",

            "Review 355: The movie opens at Don Vito Corleone's (Marlon Brando) home in the 1950s. His daughter is being wed and the entire \"family\" has come to celebrate. Vito's son Michael (Al Pacino), the most \"Americanized\" of his immediate family, has rejected the traditions of his ancestors and joined the army. He has no plans of becoming an errand boy for his father.Michael's older brother Sonny (James Caan) is hot-headed and overzealous. He is next in line to inherit \"the throne\" from Don Vito, although Vito suspects perhaps that Sonny is too heated for his own good and will never make it on his own. An important scene in the film is when he belabors his son about correcting him in front of strangers.A plot emerges involving a corrupt policeman and a competing Mafia family, who try to assassinate Don Vito and successfully murder his eldest, Sonny. Michael steps in to avenge his father's death, but must then be sent off into exile in Sicily for a short period of time to avoid the authorities, leaving behind his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton), who wants to get married.In terms of acting, its strength lies in Brando, Caan and Pacino. Brando is perfect - his trademark \"soft mouth\" being inimitable - whereas Caan is very good at turning Sonny into a multi-dimensional character. Pacino is great and displays intelligence and a certain suave aura, which is vital to the character. This was a glimpse of Al Pacino the actor before he turned on the screaming switch.Francis Ford Coppola does a wonderful job behind the camera, which is more than can be said for his efforts within the last decade. Likewise the script by Coppola and Puzo is very well-written with impressive dialogue and conflicts of the characters.\"The Godfather\" isn't exactly the *best* film ever made but it's certainly a great movie; a masterpiece that redefined epic cinema much in the same way \"Lawrence of Arabia\" did.\n",

            "Review 356: Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this \"line of business\" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but \"The Godfather\" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the \"good boy\" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor.\n",

            "Review 357: The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think \"How the heck did they come up to this idea?\" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)\n",

            "Review 358: Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations). Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time. First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more \"beautiful\"! The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion! The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!) Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being \"hit by thunderbolt\" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse.....\n",

            "Review 359: Coppola's classic interpretation of storytelling fits perfectly into this tale which many consider to be the greatest film ever made. The tragic life of michael corleone and his family against the background of the 40s new york underworld; a must-see in film-history. The scenes are extremely convincing and the atmosphere is appropriately dark and gloomy. The music accurately captures the epic scale and drama that the film is trying to get across.\n",

            "Review 360: 'The Godfather', the first part in Francis Ford Coppola's classic crime trilogy, is an almost perfect movie, with every aspect of it working to its advantage. Before this film, Coppola wasn't known much for his directorial skills. But the mastery of art he showed with this masterpiece amazed everyone.From Marlon Brando's stunning makeover to the incredible acting of almost every member of the cast, Gordon Willis' spectacular cinematography, tight editing, the remarkable background score (Nino Rota and Carmine Coppola), and almost everything else in the movie is quite flawless. No matter how many times you watch it, from the opening scene with Don Vito being asked for a favour at his daughter's wedding, to the final scene with door closing on Don Michael, the new ruthless boss of the Mafia family, the movie's three-hour long runtime captivates you till the very end. It's unlike most other crime movies with too many plot twists, action sequences, etc. The film is quite character-driven. It mainly shows the transformation of the character Michael Corleone, the war hero returning home during his sister Connie's wedding. Michael was the innocent and reluctant one in the family, who always stayed away from the family business. After certain events, he is compelled to take over the business, and it's sad and intriguing at the same time to see this character slowly evolve into something completely different from what Vito, Michael or any of us had expected. Ultimately, it's a movie all about family.Marlon Brando was not even 50 when he gives his Oscar-winning incredible performance as the head of the Corleone family. Al Pacino, who plays the central character, gets his career launched with this movie, and shows what he's capable of. Other supporting actors like James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, etc. - all of them give brilliant performances.There are so many scenes and dialogues in the movie which are more than memorable: the opening favour scene, the horse head on the studio head's bed, the sequences together showing the planned downfall of the family (including shooting of Don Vito), and especially, the craftily directed baptism scene, during which the family executes a few things to finally rise up.Nothing can be pinpointed in this movie to be called as flawed; it's an exceptional crime drama. It's an astute adaptation, and the movie stands on its own. But if it had a little more heart, I could have called it a flawless and perfect masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 361: First I would like to state that I am 20 years old this movie was made 16 years after I was born, but it is my favorite movie of all time. I really get annoyed when I hear this nonsense about young people can't judge movies because they haven't seen all the classics, well I have seen them all , Casablanca, Citizen Kane, On the Waterfront, North by Northwest and so on. I own all three of these movies, and the original is the best, 2 is very close to the original and 3 is decent. I also hate these people who judge this movie poorly because its all about Italians its pathetic I read so many comments here and everywhere that the sole basis of a poor rating is it being about Italians its a joke, Like in on the waterfront when Marlon Brando's character, transitions from a goon for organized crime to at the end of the film a changed man who wants to be a better man, Michael Corleone's character I feel is the greatest transformation in all of film history, he changes from this nice quiet military, war hero, good citizen, to a dark, ruthless, emotionless character, which he really has to do the collapse of his family. That alone i think makes this movie great, not to forget how great Marlon Brando is in this along with James Caan and Robert Duvall. This movie broke a lot of barriers in film, starting a lot of trends and setting standards for so many other mafia movies, like Goodfellas, and the Departed etc... I really think that if you have never seen it you should invest some time because you will not be disappointed.\n",

            "Review 363: I guess the same kind of folks who made The Sopranos one of the highest-rated TV shows in history made this film a 9.2 on IMDb. I sure don't get it. I think there is also a slight bias towards rating longer movies higher. Quantity does not equal, or compensate for the lack of, quality.Star-studded cast? Check. Outstanding director? Check. Dramatic and compelling plot? No.A drama should be dramatic. It should be compelling. We should care about the outcome. This film achieved none of those objectives.Some have lauded it as a fantastic sketch of organized crime. I suppose if you think of it more as a fictional docudrama, maybe your expectations would allow you to enjoy it more.The only compelling aspect of the film was the progression of Michael Corleone. The movie did bring that full circle, and I will dance around the details here to avoid spoilers. Nevertheless, that one somewhat interesting aspect was not enough to redeem the movie. And even in that aspect, the film did nothing to make the viewer CARE about Michael or why he evolved as he did.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of \"terrible\", with 5 being \"mediocre\" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)\n",

            "Review 364: As much as i did enjoy this film, and was intrigued throughout, I still don't like to see it gain the repetitive status of 'the greatest movie of all time'. I feel a movie has to have a more relevant context than the glamourised lifestyle and crooked dealings of Italian-American mafia to gain such a grand title. However, admittedly, unlike 'The Goodfellas' for instance, 'The godfather' is not glamourised that much, and I'm thankful for Coppolla turning what was at times a tedious book into a 3 hour long gripping tale. I did enjoy the book, but it's lucky that Coppolla was the man who got his hands on it. He turned some of 'The Godfather''s sections into the most mind-bendingly gripping scenes ever.In a film genre that is incredibly overrated, 'The Godfather' certainly stands head and shoulders above the rest, however, i feel it's genre should forever hold it back from being THE greatest movie of all time.\n",

The film is so good that it is mostly character driven, which tends to be boring to most, and with the subtle action, a person can hardly tell.  I guess it's the unique way the story is being told through the characters, how one man (Michael) must change all his views on life and morals to save his family, becoming a part of something he was trying to run from all his life.  At the same time Michael is working for his father's approval, even though they were on different sides of the wall of good and evil in the beginning of the film.

            "Review 373: This movie has everything a masterpiece needs. Excellent writing, compelling characters, and a story worth knowing. It tells of the politics of the Mafia in the 1940s, focusing on the Corleone family. Don Vito Corleone is a smart businessman who decides to refuse to get involved with another family's connections to the drug business, thinking it to be morally wrong. When an assassination attempt on his life leaves the Boss in a critical condition, his sons must take over the day to day operations in the midst of the war that has been started. Throughout the film we see the truth behind the violence, the stress of being involved with a powerful family, and the political undertones of Mafia life. We especially see all of these effects in Michael Corleone. He is the youngest son of Don Corleone, and a war hero. However, due to the things happening throughout the story, Michael portrays a man's descent into a different life. Some great things about this movie are first off, the acting. Each person in this movie, no matter how small their role is, has a story to tell and they all tell those stories beautifully. Second, the language. Many scenes in this movie are spoken almost exclusively in Italian. Without subtitles. It added an authenticity unlike any movie I've seen before. Beautifully well done, excellently put together, an obvious masterpiece, even with being very slow paced at times. If you have yet to see this film, do so this instant.\n",

The acting was good, but Marlon Brando was annoying--his weirdy voice is infamous, but I couldn't understand anything he said! It sounded very flaccid and emotionless, too.The story itself seemed very pointless... Michael Corleone kills a bunch of people, mob hits, his father gets shot or something, he becomes the new Godfather or something. Nothing had shown itself much changed or resolved. Didn't serve a purpose other than to show a bunch of cursing and killing. With thick accents.The mood was also very very cold-hearted. There's a general complaint about Steven Spielberg's \"Munich\" that it's very cold, too, that the characters don't have a warmth to them that you can identify with. \"The Godfather\" characters are like this too. You can't identify with any of the characters because they seem so heartless and cold, not even with a hint of charm to them to make you like them, except maybe Marlon Brando, who seemed like a crazy old grandpa who's half-senile.I can't see the classic status of this movie.

Every character is given time to develop and leave his/her mark on the movie.It starts with Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando) heading the Corleone crime family. Even though it doesn't deal in vices like prostitution and gambling, the Corleone family is the biggest and the strongest crime family in New York! It is made up of family and loyal friends of Don Vito- like the terrifying Luca, the muscle-maker Clemenza, the smart tactician Tessio, an adopted German-Irish son Tom and the hot-headed eldest blood of Vito Sonny among the others.The Don hears various requests from his troubled friends and uses his contacts in order to help them out, asking for nothing but loyalty and friendship in return.This calm boat is however rocked by heavy waters when the Turk Virgil Sollozo meets Don Vito Corleone to ask for protection and finance for his narcotics business. Don Corleone refuses. However during the meeting, Sonny shoots off his mouth and shows that he is interested in the deal. And that starts unfolding of a spiral of events.Vito is shot. Sonny is killed. Fredo, the second son of Don Vito, is sent away to Vegas under protection. Michael Corleone, the reluctant outside, who has led his life they he wanted, away from his father's influence takes over the family reins from his ailing father.Then transcripts a story of Michael from a family outsider to a ruthless Mafia boss.After Vito dies, Michael arranges to assassinate Tessio who's turned a traitor, Moe Green- who was a block in Michael's path to buying the entire stake in a Las Vegas Hotel, and the heads of the other families- Stracci, Cuneo, Barzini and Tattaglia! Michael cleverly gets his brother-in-law Carlo Rizzi assassinated who was responsible for Sonny's murder.With all the other heads of the Five New York Families dead, Michael Corleone becomes the undisputed leader of the Underworld in New York. In the final scene, he is surrounded by his loyalists- Rocco Lampone, Al Neri and the good old Clemenza who refers to Michael as \"Don Corleone\" before the scene blacks out!Unlike the Mafia films back then, The Godfather portrayed the Underworld as a response to the corrupt politicians rather than goons with guns and money!Undoubtedly, it still remains the greatest Masterpiece in World Cinema even today after more than 47 years and will continue to remain so for centuries to come!\"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse!\"\n",

The performances by everyone are absolutely magnificent and possibly the best ensemble cast performance of all time, the actors live in their roles and do everything is done perfectly down to the last little detail, the screenplay and storyline are magnificent as the story evolves you get a engrossed in it and every second is epic, all the themes are well presented and the acting just makes everything stronger, I wasn't bored for a second. The music (original and not) is perfect and goes with the film and every time you hear it it reminds you of the film and the characters. This film is just the first out of three in the great Corleone saga but although i award the other two a 10/10 this one is the best in my opinion simply because it has so many memorable cinematic scenes that are some of the best in history but the other two films complete this one and add more to the story. All that said this movie should not be missed and anyone who enjoys cinema needs to check this out and then follow the rest of the story with the others. A true classic. 10/10\n",

            "Review 381: I cannot express strongly enough how bad this movie sucks. Great music, great actors - but what does that give you? Coppola has everyone but his nursemaid employed in this one; Puzo's screenplay is pure speculation and nothing but - and the mob supposedly loved it; but people took this seriously: they really thought Puzo (and Coppola) had an inside track when they did not. And Puzo and Coppola knew full well what they were doing, making this movie as unconscionable as they come. And after that I don't care how many monkey movies Brando studied at home, or whether he propped his cheeks with orange segments or thousand dollar bills: this movie is cheap, and it sucks, and please tell me: if Coppola is all that good, why is there nothing coming out of that supposedly great mind of his? Nothing but the same old schtick, the same three worn out pseudo epics, the same three better forgotten films, recycled and recycled and recycled? No one gets this, but despite the great acting ensemble, this movie, its two follow-ups, its creator and director, and its screenwriter are the biggest bunch of hyped losers in Hollywood history.\n",

            "Review 382: The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period...\n",

            "Review 384: I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10\n",

            "Review 385: After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.\n",

            "Review 386: Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the aging Don of the Corleone crime family, the strongest of the five Mafia families in New York City (Barzini, Tattaglia, Cuneo, and Stracci are their rivals). He has four sons: Santino \"Sonny\" (James Caan), Frederico \"Fredo\" (John Cazele) Michael (Al Pacino), his adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who serves as the family consigliere, and a daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Sonny is the underboss of the family. With Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano) and Salvatore Tessio (Abe Vigoda) are the caporegimes. Soldiers under Clemenza and Tessio include Paulie Gatto (Joe Martino), Willy Cici (Joe Spinelli) and Rocco Lampone (Tom Rosqui), and more. Michael wants nothing to do with \"the family\" and attempts to legitimize himself by going to college and the army, while his brothers are trying very hard to establish their names in the city through the Mafia underworld.The Corleone family soon become engaged in a ten-year war against the other families. They nearly slip from power. But they stand their ground and fight for their power.The Godfather is based on the bestselling novel by Mario Puzo, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Francis Ford Coppola. The movie remains about 90% true to Puzo's masterpiece of a book, only tossing out flashback scenes (which are instead moved into The Godfather Part II) and killing off two characters that weren't killed in the book.The Godfather has earned its place in cinema history, it is considered a landmark film. This is a movie about family and careers. Not an accurate picture of a gangster's life, but still one of the greatest movies based around the Mafia. For an accurate look at mob life, watch Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas or Mike Newell's Donnie Brasco. The movie also started James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Al Pacino's careers. All of these men are accomplished actors now.Marlon Brando earned a well-deserved Academy award for Best Actor because of his superb performance as Don Vito Corleone. The movie also earned Best Picture and Best Adapted Screenplay. The movie certainly deserved all of its awards.I, as well as many others, hold the film in high regard. This film is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, YOU MUST.10/10\n",

            "Review 387: I saw Godfather when it came out. I don't remember the movie but I remember going out to the lobby 2-3 times to get away from it and take a break. It was soooooooooooooo boring. It was like it was in slow motion or something and I just didn't care about anyone or anything including the plot.I recall hearing that Brando stuffed cotton balls in his cheeks to get that effect and I couldn't not think about it during the movie. It looks like a lot of movie was spent on this movie to create the look of a certain era but so what.I could see people's lips moving and hear people talking but the dialog might as well have been entirely in Italian as I had trouble paying attention. My mind would wander and I really didn't follow the plot or care. For some reason, the dialog seemed trapped in the movie itself as though I was watching it through a window that was muffling the sound a bit. Weird.Many people may think this is the best movie ever but many people also thought the earth was flat in 1491. When it comes to movies, it only matters to me what I think.\n",

            "Review 388: What matters is family, you pick a side and you stay on that side, if you switch side, you're the enemy and will forever be the enemy until you're dead. You look out for your family, and make sure everyone is okay. You don't discuss business at the table when having dinner. Power and Money - \"Business\" comes second! It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats. Ah, I just love this movie, slow pace and leaves nothing for your imagination (sometimes I don't like that about a film, but it works in this one). Can we just take a minute to appreciate Marlon Brando's role interpretation, I love the way he worked with the body language, his voice and acting calm. And same goes for Al Pacino, just amazing!

Just some people who handling the business. I found also the start of Michael very good to watch and interesting to see. He is not uused to do this but learn. I found the movie pretty classic sadly. The violent scenes looks outdated now. What i found interesting i mean in the cinematography was at the end: the opposition of violence and the church scenes. That was interesting to see and look interesting visually. And the fall of Don Corleone make the whole thing more hard for the son, Michael. I also found the characters's arcs interesting and what they become. I enjoyed also the dialogues and have strong acts with families and honour. But it look really superficial but what i found really strong is the end: because we see the fall with the Don Corleone and the rise at the end with the new status of the Kid: Michael become the Godfather. And the image at the end was so meaningful and look the same as the father in some way.\n",

            "Review 391: This film seems to polarize viewers - you either love it or hate it. That's how I felt about The Godfather initially. To be honest, I avoided watching it for a long time without really knowing why. I assumed people were overhyping it, and I couldn't grasp why Mafia-themed movies received such high praise.However, my perspective changed when I stumbled upon a game called Mafia II. Intrigued, I gave it a shot, and to my delight, it was fantastic! The writing, soundtrack, and gripping story captivated me. When I shared my excitement with a friend, they pointed out that Mafia drew inspiration from The Godfather, suggesting I might enjoy the film if I liked the game.Taking their advice, I finally decided to watch The Godfather today, and I'm thrilled that I did. While I understand why some might find it slow-paced, I was mesmerized by the characters' story arcs, particularly Michael Corleone's transformation from a noble figure to a ruthless leader. It was a remarkable journey to witness, making this film one of the greatest I've ever seen. While the entire cast delivered stellar performances, I must say Al Pacino's portrayal stole the spotlight, surpassing even Marlon Brando.I wholeheartedly recommend this film to everyone. Ignore the hype and simply immerse yourself in the experience. I'm eager to delve into Parts II and III soon.\n",

            "Review 392: Where do you even start with a film like this? There are so many layers to The Godfather, so many little intricacies among the plot, that it is simply impossible to fully analyze this film in one review. With this in mind, I'm just going to give some of my thoughts on the film here.The Godfather does not really have one focused plot line that you can point to. It really just focuses on the inner dealings of the Corleone crime family. There are many things going on, but at its core, it is a film about this family. Through this, though, there are a few stories told. We see the fall of the once immensely powerful Don Vito Corleone, and then, as it would appear at the end of the film, the eventual rise of the family again under its new leader. We see the transformation of Michael, the Don's youngest son, throughout the movie, as he goes from the young man that wanted nothing to do with his family's illegal business to the man in charge of the whole thing. We also witness the terrible and bloody gang war that the Corleone family becomes deeply involved in. Ultimately, The Godfather tells an incredible story, or multiple connected stories, revolving around the Corleone family, as we learn about the inner dealings of this crime organization along the way. From the opening scene, I was completely pulled into the story of this family, and didn't return to reality until the end credits started rolling. It was truly an intriguing and fascinating tale that I couldn't get enough of.Perhaps the most interesting part of the film was the story of Michael Corleone, played by Al Pacino. His eventual rise through the ranks to the new head of the Corleone crime family is so intriguing because of his transformation as a person that was required to make this happen. He becomes more and more morally corrupt as the film goes on, until at the end he becomes the cold-hearted, ruthless leader of the crime family. The film does an excellent job of illustrating what you have to become to rise to the top in a business like this, and shows how these leaders end up having to lose a bit of their humanity to be able to do the things that are necessary to keep their power.Francis Ford Coppola's masterful direction is one of the main factors that made this film as iconic as it is. The overall mood of each scene is done perfectly; nothing ever feels out of place, everything always feels like it was done exactly as it should be. In fact, I can't really think of anything at all that should have been done different. The one thing throughout the whole film that was messed up slightly was when Sonny was beating up Carlo in the street. You see one punch that clearly was way off, yet Carlo still reacts as if he were hit. It's a very minor detail that can be missed quite easily, but it pulls you out of the film for a moment. Once you get a visual reminder that these are all actors on the screen, it can throw you off just a bit for the rest of the movie and taint your enjoyment of it. Of course, this didn't happen as everything else was done to perfection, so nothing really bad came of this one minor hiccup. The film is still a masterpiece, and a few seconds of confusion won't ruin that.The iconic cinematography of this film is also such a key part of it. The low-lighting used in many of the scenes captures the mood of so many of the moments, especially in the first sequence of the film. Vito Corleone's daughter is having a wedding outside, and the sun is shining and everyone is dancing and happy. Then, throughout the wedding, the scene will switch to inside, where Vito will be talking business with someone. In these moments, the background is so dark we can barely see the characters. This important feature draws attention to how dark and shady the family business is, in contrast to the overall upbeat and hopeful tone of the wedding. There are many more instances quite like this in the film, but I am not going to point them all out, as, like I said, it is impossible to talk about all of the details of this film in one review. In short, the cinematography and use of lighting are used to perfection to help the viewer derive the mood of the situation from scene to scene.The score of this film is just as iconic as everything else about it. The music is fittingly dark and used to appropriately set the mood at the right times. It is perhaps one of the best scores ever composed for a film; if not, it is certainly one of the most iconic.The movies epic 175 minute runtime does not feel excessive or unnecessary like some 3-hour films can. Instead, it feels just right for the story it is telling, and somehow manages to never overstay its welcome. The lengthy runtime feels completely justified due to the overall nature of a film like this, and there is really nothing I can think of that could be taken out without negatively affecting the final product.The acting in this film is absolutely outstanding. It's stunning how great the cast is at times. Some of the most interesting characters ever created were brought to life by these incredible performances.Marlon Brando is on a whole different level is this film. There are so many times you can't even believe he's acting. His iconic voice and line delivery has created some of the most iconic and recognizable quotes ever. The performance he gives is chillingly effective and almost frightening, and fittingly so. It is simply one of the best displays of acting I have ever seen.Al Pacino is also outstanding in this film. I believe he had the most screen time in the movie (despite his best supporting actor nomination), and he does a great job of living up to that. It is really his first iconic role, and it ended up becoming perhaps his most iconic role. Perhaps he doesn't outperform Brando, but he certainly does as good as anyone possibly could at living up to the standard that Brando sets from the opening scene.James Caan and Robert Duvall do not disappoint either, giving strong performances to back up Brando and Pacino. In fact, there is not a single member of the cast who I think underperforms. At the very least, everyone did their job well, with many going above and beyond to make this movie the incredible achievement that it is.And then there's the big question: does this film stand the test of time? The answer is yes. The Godfather is a timeless classic that I really don't see ever falling off. Many of the themes are still relevant today, and even without that, it is worth watching simply for the incredible cinematic achievement that it is, and the filmmaking lessons that can be learned from it.The Godfather is, in short, an epic masterpiece of a film. The direction, story, acting, cinematography, music; all are outstanding and iconic, and they all come together to make this incredible, nearly flawless movie. This review really only scratches the surface of all this movie has to offer, as there is just so much under the surface to be uncovered through deep analysis of this film. Because of this, I would recommend multiple viewings of the film to ensure you are getting the full experience and not missing anything. I know that I will certainly be watching this many more times in the years to come. It is almost undoubtedly one of the best films ever made, and one that everyone has to see at least once in their lives.\n",

            "Review 393: And i have to say the book is so captivating and gives so many additional layers to the characters presented in the movie. \"The Godfather\" is very well directed and acted film. Also, almost all the scenes are very truthful to the source material. No wonder the movie is \"Mario Puzo's The Godfather\". From a classical movie perspective there's a lot to appreciate. I think they tried to be as authentic as possible casting Italian actors, but some were pretty weak in their performance. Also some didn't fit the character very well - I really can't accept Robert Duval as Tom Hagen. The ending of the movie also felt so much more rushed. With the pace it was all going I thought the ending of the book was going to be unfolder in the second movie, but that wasn't the case. Suddenly everything just happened quickly and that was it. I don't know, but I'm getting regrets that I didn't see the movie first. Honestly, Mario Puzo set the bar pretty high.\n",

Honestly, you can't expect me to get attached to characters if they're just going to be killed off in 20 minutes of being introduced.It has a very episodic structure in that things are set up, but never revisited. For example, in the beginning of the film, there is a subplot of one of the family blackmailing a director to put someone in his film. After putting his horse's head in his bead, he accepts. This storyline is never visited again. What was the point?This honestly put me in such a bad mood, and movies shouldn't do that. I want to enjoy myself during a viewing and be invested in the story, not want it to end as soon as possible.\n",

            "Review 395: I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichés. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them.\n",

            "Review 398: There is no denying that the Godfather is a classic and one of the best movies ever made. It is a saga of a major Mafia father, the upper echelons and there struggles. It starts with Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) on the day of his daughter's wedding and doing favours for people invited to the wedding. The films shows the outcome of these favours, including the famous sense of the horse's head in the bed. The film then shows Vito refusing to take part in selling drugs and ends up having an assassination attempt against him. The Corleone family is forced into a tuft war before peace is made. At the same time the Godfather shows Michael's (Al Panico) rise in the family, from being a bit of an outsider not wanting to get involved to becoming the head of family after Vito's death. The film shows how person relationships developed and shows the characters as real people. It shows how the Mafia would have worked in the 1950s, focusing on deal making, rising up the ranks and showing acts of violence being conducted.The gangster film was not a new genre, their were good films in the film noir period such as Scarface, Little Caesar and the Killing. However I am not aware of any major gangster films in the 60s. The Godfather focused on the characters and many different and complex plots and subplots. It was able to bring in more violence into the genre because by the late 60s films were allowed to show more violence. The film also benefits from a brilliant script, the excellent direction of Francis Ford Coppella (this film along with The Godfather Part II are his best films) and a brilliant cast. Marlon Brando was brought back into the mainstream after gaining a reputation for being an ego-maniac, and help made the careers of Al Panico, James Caan and Diane Keaton. This was also the first film I aware of focusing mainly on the Mafia and how it functions. I remember watching a document on the making of the film on Channel Four and how difficult it was for the filmmakers, fighting with the Italian-American community.The Godfather and Godfather Part II are both classics and must watch films. I admit I have not watched Godfather Part III but that because I heard it wasn't as good and ruins the first two. It has been very influential in the gangster genre afterwards. They was Once Upon A Time in America which was similar in it approach, having many story lines and themes and similar filming of violence. They was Goodfellas which forced on foot-soldiers of the Mafia and set mainly in the 60s and 70s when it was filmed in the 80s. They are also films like Casino and American Gangster, the list goes on. They are also parodies such as Family Business and programmes such as the Simpsons, Futurama and Family Guy. Finally their was the Sopranos (one of the best programmes ever made), mixing elements of the Godfather and Goodfellas. All in all the Godfather is a very important film.\n",

I have actually notice a couple of new things that have made me appreciate the film even more! Quite frankly, it really ie insane just how good it is and how even 50 years later, it totally still holds up! A masterpiece of complete brilliance with genius storylines interconnected so beautifully ultimately making it super satisfying for audiences to connect the dots and really understand what's actually going on. The picture really showcases what life in the mafia is like and it is done with so much heart that you genuinely love and care about these characters as they are actually pretty relatable characters who often make a lot of sense, but yet are unfortunately born into a family full of crime! There are really not that many films out there that successfully manage to give the viewer an exciting and thrilling viewing experience, no matter how often they watch it. A real masterpiece by its definition filled with all-time great and iconic performances that essentially make up for an iconic, timeless classic that really has stood the test of time and presumably will be relevant! One of those films humanity can be proud of when looking back at pop cultural trends that have happened over time. Always a genuine privilege for me whenever I watch this beauty! 10/10.\n",

            "Review 400: 4/4 ESSENTIALThe Godfather (1972) took many aspects essential to a film and pushed them past anything that had been done before. This movie takes the Corleone family, a mafia of sorts based out of NY, and creates for them an exclusive atmosphere. We get to see the Corleones in their criminal endeavors, interacting with the other crime families in NY, and working to make their family come out on top completely from their point of view. We never feel anything \"civilian\", nothing ever tugs at you that these people are evil. This is due in part to the phenomenal performances of (specifically) Al Pacino and Marlon Brando.As far as script, any screenplay that can isolate your conscience and also entertain you is truly Grade A for a movie of this genre. Mario Puzo, of course, had experience with this story as it's based on his novel. That made him the obvious and excellent choice. These characters don't feel like actors at any point, they feel like family. Every member of the family has his own strengths and weakness that develop over the course of the movie, and they balance each other out perfectly. It's rare to find a movie with characters this real... nothing feels forced.Coppola's keen attention to the smallest details makes this movie even more perfect. Look out for oranges appearing in the movie: they will always foreshadow a death in the Corleone family... He will always accompany the tone with lighting (a perfect example being the beginning sequence, which interchanges the mortician's visit to The Godfather and Connie's wedding with Carlos) and colors (darker shades of yellow and velvet are prevalent in most scenes with Don Corleone). Also, in The Godfather, there is a noticeable camera theme: fading drag-shots. Whenever these montages come up, they are accompanied by a very upbeat melody. Coppola borrows this tactic 11 years later when directing The Outsiders (1983).The Godfather is a true classic, and my all-time favorite movie. It over-delivers and then some. Make a point to see this epic.\n",

            "Review 401: \"The Godfather\" was a sickening experience the first time I saw it in its initial release, and it hasn't changed.  I thoroughly disliked the film's spirit, finding it very ugly at its heart. I saw little justification for its existence, was sorry I saw it, and have tried to forget it.\n",

            "Review 402: This is my most favorite movie of all time.Words cannot describe its greatness.I have heard all kinds of stories about when it first came out and how people were constantly praising it but it's for a reason believe me.This film has the finest acting i have ever seen.You don't believe - then watch this masterpiece and see what i'm talking about.All the actors shine:Al Pacino,Robert Duvall,James Caan and the others were born to play their roles and you can see how passionate they were while playing.But the greatest one of them all is undoubtedly the GREAT Marlon Brando who was so eager to play the role that he sent director F.F.Coppola a tape on which he presents his way of playing the Godfather.Coppola is immediately impressed and hires Brando.From here it's all history in the making.The most emotional and powerful moment is when the Godfather gets shot.Pure brilliance.Every time I see that scene it sends shivers down my spine.If I have to be honest every scene has its impact and emotional message.If you haven't seen the movie yet fix your mistake and watch it right now.You'll be amazed!!!\n",

I have nothing against Italians, the Mafia or any of the principals, but best film ever? Never. It was an entertaining film, which displayed some rather ridiculous acting, in a gross piece of defamation perpetrated on the Italians. I have nothing again violence and gore... even sex, on screen when appropriate, but this is a ludicrous consensus your readership has reached and it must be corrected.\n",

            "Review 405: The Godfather is a true classic. What differs this movie from others is the realism and that it's very believable. I thought 2 1/2 hour would be a long time, but time really flies when you're having fun! The movie follows the Carleone family, a good old Italian-American mafia family. The year is 1946 and the drug-market is just opening. When the Carleone refuses to take any part in this business some of the ones counting on this get's mad.The movie is based on the book by Mario Puzo. It's a well written movie. A smart thing to let Mario Puzo do the screenplay as he knows all the characters and the story inside and out. The story is not a simple one and there are quite a few characters. That might make the story confusing, but if you just pay attention you'll do fine. The characters and the combination of characters are great. We have a kind of anti-hero (Michael), the boss (Don Vito), the trigger happy (Sonny), the bystander (Hagen) and more. That gives plenty of opportunities for conflicts between them. The characters are very believable and you get to know them, what kind of persons they are. The story and action is also very good. You get caught up and dragged into another world. The dialog, witch is important to this movie is well written. It's not that typical movie where everyone knows what to say at any time. There are silence and thought-breaks, that makes it all more casual and normal.The actors are very good. The have settled for nothing less than quality actors in all roles. They use Italian-Americans and that makes it all more believable. Marlon Brando and does a good job and will forever be remembered as Don Carleone. Al Pachino's performance is nothing less than great. The rest of the cast are also very good an delivers a very good performance.The cinematography is classic. There are nothing really special about it, but it's all over good. The composition is good and the lightning is nice. They've captured the mood very well. It's not happy, it's not dark, it's something in between. There are no shots that stands out in a bad way, so you don't really pay attention to it. You just focus on the story.The sets, decoration and costumes are incredible. It's very realistic. It's 40's all the way, yet you don't really think about it. You never stop to think that \"this is the 40's\". It all just comes natural. It really helps you get caught up in the movie. Not once do you think \"why don't he just pick up a cell phone?\", because it all seem so realistic and well done.Nino Rota has made a forever memorable score. It's classic and easy to recognize. It makes a nice, kind of gloomy mood, and fits the rest of the movie perfect. I also like the lack of music. In the action scenes there are no music. This makes it more tense, personal and human.There are some special effects in this movies. Some blood, fights, shots and explosions, but it not that much. What there is is rather good. Some it has a little theatrical look to it and therefor I'm glad they didn't make a big deal out of it. The fact that they don't literally overkill and focus on this makes the story more serious and much more believable. This movie is no action movie, but 100% drama at it's finest.The Godfater is a classic, must-see movie for everyone. It has a special place in movie history. It almost a legend. If you like movies this is not a movie to miss. It's a little long, but don't let that scare you. My tip is to watch this movie when you're up to it. If you watch at the wrong time it'll destroy you impression of it, but when you get the chance, watch it!\n",

            "Review 406: And so I finally decided to watch the second highest rated movie of all time. I must have missed something here, because I found this glorified family drama talky insanely boring! Note, this review might contain spoilers. It's the only way for me to remember this dreary movie...This 3-hour talk-fest depicts the lives of the Italian crime family Corleone. At least somewhere at the 40-minute mark and I think once later in the film, as well, there was gunfire to keep me awake. As for the rest of the movie, it felt like I was watching a few dozen episodes of a daily soap-opera. Yawn!At the head of the family is Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). The film starts with the wedding of his daughter, Connie, to Carlo Rizzi. This wedding lasts the first 27 minutes of the movie. Here we meet the family. There's Don's sons Michael, Sonny and Fredo (who is an insignificant character who might as well not have been there), and Tom Hagen, whom the family took in when Sonny found him homeless wandering the streets. Michael's girlfriend is Kay, but when he flees later in the movie he marries another woman on impulse without giving Kay a second thought!!!!The Corleones is a wealthy and powerful crime family. When drug lord Sollozzo approaches Don with a business proposition, Don declines. Later, Sollozzo has Don shot, and kidnaps Tom. So, Don Corleone is the film's lead character, but once he is shot around the 40-minute mark, he disappears for most of the movie...or, well, he is there, but bed-ridden and inactive. He doesn't even play a big part during the film's finale. I thought he was supposed to be the protagonist, but he takes a back seat for most of the movie. And why is he talking in that annoying whispering voice?'The Godfather' is a very involved film with many characters to keep track of. In all honesty, I found the film dragging and boring. There's no defined goal. There's no defined protagonist. There's no defined antagonist.There's no denying 'The Godfather' is a well written, well made movie with superb performances from a stellar cast, but it doesn't even nearly rate among my favourite movies. The purpose of watching a movie, is to be entertained. Unfortunately, with 'The Godfather' I wasn't. Even my partner yawned on several occasions asking me if this really was the second highest rated movie. I'm sorry, this is not for me. Yawn, already, yawn! Maybe back in the 1972 it was special, but with so many (much better) movies out there, I found 'The Godfather' forgettable...\n",

            "Review 407: Because this movie has Extraordinary performances, amazing direction, incredible screenplay, and an excellent soundtrack, it's more than good, more than great, it's perfection in every way. When I first saw this movie, I was 10 years old, and I couldn't stand it, and now I love it, so be patient, watch this movie and observe every detail, that will make it unforgettable.Vito Corleone(Brando) is the aging don (head) of the Corleone Mafia Family. His youngest son Michael(Pacino) has returned from WWII just in time to see the wedding of Connie Corleone (Tania Shire, Michael's sister) to Carlo Rizzi(Russo). All of Michael's family is involved with the Mafia, but Michael just wants to live a normal life. Drug dealer Virgil Sollozzo(Lettieri) is looking for Mafia Families to offer him protection in exchange for a profit of the drug money. He approaches Don Corleone about it, but, much against the advice of the Don's lawyer Tom Hagen(Duvall), the Don is morally against the use of drugs, and turns down the offer. This does not please Sollozzo, who has the Don shot down by some of his hit men. The Don barely survives, which leads his son Michael to begin a violent mob war against Sollozzo and tears the Corleone family apart.Everybody says that the movie gets everything right, and it's true. This movie follows a narrative rhythm that is impeccable, it never slows down too much, and that's because the whole movie is slow. And in some tense scenes (Like the scene where Michael is changing his father's room in the hospital), and even some funny ones (When Michael is in Sicily talking to a man about that girl that he met, and the guy finds out that she's his daughter), it's done with excellency.The screenplay is one of the best ever made. It develops it's character so well, that almost everyone is learning something during the story. And of course, it gives us memorable quotes like the classic \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse!\" or \"I'm a superstitious man!\". The Soundtrack by Nino Rota is brilliant, and you can notice that right in the first scene.The acting is equally impressing, even Pacino that don't usually blows my mind like everyone says (Not that he is a bad actor, he's excellent, but I prefer contained and calm performances), impressed me a lot, he's so cold and looks so smart that make his turns believable and intelligent. Brando gives one the best performances the world has ever seen, and considering that he was 48 when this movie was released, he convinced me that he was a sick, old man (Which Pacino didn't do that well in \"The Godfather: Part III\"). And observe the scene where Hagen tells him about Sonny, and you'll see what I mean by saying that it's one of the best of all time.Verdict: A lot of people, including me, say that it's the best movie ever made, so they probably have a good reason to say that.\n",

            "Review 408: I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film.\n",

            "Review 410: The Godfather follows Vito Corleone, the titular character, sinisterly played by Marlon Brando, as he tries to develop his son, Michael (a young and excellent Al Pacino) to become the 'Don' of the Corleone family, albeit in a violent and dangerous, Mafia dominating New York.The first thing that I noticed was the lighting. I thought that it perfectly encapsulated the two natures of the Corleone family: the terrifying and ruthless yet fiercely family orientated. Corleone is constantly in the shadow, while also being in the light, and it highlights the two sided nature of him.The next amazing thing about this is the acting. Brando nails the mysteriously dangerous family man who is feared and respected in equal manner. Al Pacino is amazing and nails the arc of war hero, innocent and loved, to Brando's protege, as he turns into the evil Don. The supporting actors of James Caan, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall get a good showing, perfectly supporting the two main ones (Al Pacino should have got leading actor!)The score and editing creates this beautiful Italian set piece, and it's stunning.\n",

            "Review 412: Ladies and gentlemen, I happen to think that this is a major milestone in my film review career. This is my 500th review on IMDb. I feel proud, I feel excited and yet now I have 1000 in my eyes and shooting for the stars. Thank you to everyone who reads and enjoys my reviews because I love watching the movies...even the bad ones...but I am excited about 2007's Summer films coming out. Live Free or Die Hard is one of my most anticipated!! To choose the film that I would bestow my 500th review on was actually very simple. I knew it had to be a classic, something perhaps controversial and to me The Godfather was the obvious choice. To some The Godfather is considered the finest film ever made...period. It might be the mostly widely accepted classic in cinema history and there is good reason behind it. The Godfather is also currently the highest rated film on IMDb (currently getting an outstanding 9.8 average.) So let's talk about The Godfather.For me The Godfather is true brilliance...I won't argue with it and I came into this review determined to nit pick this classic and try to find something slightly off with it. I couldn't do it...I couldn't find a single reason why I wouldn't slap a 10/10 on this...so I did. The Godfather is far more than a 'gangster flick,' it's far beyond Goodfellas, Casino, or The Sopranos because The Godfather is a drama, a deep intense, disturbing, dark drama that draws you into this political, violent, gritty world that this family lives and breaths and has for years. You see a man who grew up in this lifestyle under the most powerful man in the underworld and yet chose to turn away from it but is almost destined to be pulled back towards it and take control of the powerful family. Every scene in The Godfather is done with the utmost care and respect, the characters are so intensely created from the smallest roles, to the biggest and you feel like you're right there. From the streets of New York, to the countryside of Sicily, from brutal murders and assassinations, to marriages, funerals, and births. The Godfather is quite simply an astounding piece of epic cinema.Marlon Brando because he is Hollywood Elite certainly gets top billing for the film. I admit I have only seen Brando in a handful of films and The Godfather is the earliest work of his I have seen so I have not seen Brando in his 'classic' Hollywood roles. I just don't think Brando should have gotten top billing, that being said Marlon Brand IS The Godfather. The only problem is that throughout the film he is aged, delicate and sickly so that we don't see him in what would have been his prime and yet with every movement and word that Brando does you can envision Vito Corleone as the powerful figure he once was. Brando IS The Godfather...period. Al Pacino is the true star of this film. He brilliant creates the son of Vito Corleone Michael. As a character Michael goes through more diverse changes than anyone else. In the beginning he is a returning war hero, desperate to keep his distance from his family name and family business and yet by the end he IS The Godfather...Don Corleone and single handedly has saved his families future. Pacino is downright brilliant and I love his work but this is one of his truly best performances. Pacino was absolutely robbed by not receiving a nomination or win for this performance when Brando got both and didn't even accept it. Pacino turns in a better and more depthy performance by far. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot headed and easily angered Santino Corleone who is forced into the position of heading the family when his father is almost assassination. Caan doesn't get as much screen time as his character deserved but nonetheless makes 'Sonny' one of the most memorable characters from the film. Robert Duvall turns in probably one of the second best performances in the film as soft spoken, legally minded and intelligent Tom Hagen who tries to guide the Corleone family through the worst of times both diplomatically and strategically. He never dirties his own hands but is always willing to do what necessary to protect the family. Duvall is brilliant as well. This main cast is supported by a brilliant supporting cast including Richard S. Castellano, Diane Keaton, Abe Vigoda, Talia Shire, John Cazale, Al Martino, and Lenny Montana (all of these actors stand out from the enormous cast as important and well played characters.) As you watch the film you might even think it's dragging a little and thinking it's a little slow but then you're so incredibly caught up in every moment and every story of this family that you're completely enthralled. Their are more brilliant and shocking scenes than almost any other film in history including...Michael's first wife's death, the horse head in the bed, the Assassination Michael performs in the Restaurant and the downright poetically disturbing murder of all the five family heads at the end. Director Francis Ford Coppola set himself apart permanently in the history of cinema by making this beautiful, gritty and quietly violent film. Mario Puzo wrote characters that have so much depth and importance and such real emotion to them. It might take awhile to get through The Godfather but every minute is worth it because this film lives up to it's powerful name and is truly worth the title of classic. 10/10Keep reading my reviews and see you at 1000!!!

Lots of happening make in interesting and more importantly engaging. I strongly feel that this movie is not for those who do not like the revenge or the other way around about not found of mind games and politics.Now the hall mark is the acting of Brando which takes this to all time high. Alogn with this, Al Pacino did a well job. But music score of the movie needs a special mention. I still feel that the effect might not be that strong without such hammer strong music.In the end... just like to say... watch it ... again and again and always you will find something very special.\n",

            "Review 414: We won't know until about twenty years from now whether the films we watch in the nineties are classics. Personally I think only three can justify such a title so far - Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption and La Vita e Bella. Three movies without anything missing. Of all the movies in the seventies only two can fill the classic criteria and they share similar titles. Godfather 1 and 2.People can argue about Jaws and Star Wars but those movies scripts were rubbish. They were all about spectacle. No movie could compare to the quality of the Godfather. In fact the Godfather blows its closest rival out of the water: its closest rival being its sequel.The Godfather is unlike any movie I ever saw. It begins with a great scene as a man comes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) to ask for his help in hurting a guy that has raped his daughter. It is Brando's daughters wedding day and the man who has come to the Godfather never gave Corleone any help before. Brando refuses. It is a brilliant scene introducing us to the world of the Corleone's. We see how ruthless the Godfather can be but we also see his loyalty to his family. It is a scene that will be hard to match in cinema history but Coppola goes on to deliver even more spellbinding scenes. This is the beauty of the Godfather - every single scene is fabulous. No other film can compare to its class.Some people argue that the Godfather part 2 is better. Not a chance. It's good but it can't compare to this movie.\n",

            "Review 415: `I believe in America' are the first words spoken in The Godfather. The fact that they resonate with such power to someone who has no personal or professional ties with the country speaks volumes. My first viewing of this film was anticipated with equal amounts excitement and trepidation. How could a film of such enormous stature possibly live up to anyone's expectations, let alone mine? Over two and a half hours later I realised I would probably never see a finer film in my life. And about six or seven years on from that revelatory experience, that view grows ever stronger. With the exception of The Godfather Part Two that is. But that's a film for another day. The Godfather is now so much a part of our culture that it becomes difficult to talk about it as a film by itself. Entire books have been written on how it has not only affected change in the way films are conceived by individuals and whole studios, but also the very nature of the film industry itself. At the time nobody could have predicted that a lengthy (and costly) film set in the 1940's with a relatively little know cast and a serious and weighty subject matter could have made such a huge profit at the box office. Much like in the film itself, ambition and bravado is rewarded with great success and power, and this was true for many of the cast and crew with their subsequent careers. There may be spoilers ahead but the plot and events in this film are now so well documented I doubt anyone will be surprised.The film opens with a wedding taking place between Don Vito Corleone's daughter, Connie and Carlo, a wannabe member of the Family. While the celebrations take place outside in glorious sunshine, in the darkened rooms of the main house Don Vito pays court to various people requesting help with whatever problems they need assistance with. This is where Bonasera, a local baker, opens the film with the aforementioned line and seeks revenge on two men who savagely beat his daughter after she refused their advances. The subsequent conversation sets the tone for the rest of the film. Respect is always demanded from those in power and who are willing to use that power to benefit you. But there may always be a favour required by The Don in return. Later in the film, this favour is repaid to The Don in a way that is both shocking and relieving to Bonasera. Every element in this first scene demands attention from the audience and rewards them by setting a very high standard thereon. The way the camera slowly pulls back from Bonasera to reveal The Don listening to the story as we are, the use of lighting to almost hide The Don's eyes in the darkness, and the expressions, the voice and even the movement of Marlon Brando as The Don immediately put us in the company of one of THE great acting performances. Also attendant at the wedding are The Don's sons, Sonny the firey tempered James Cann, the weak willed Fredo played by John Cazale and Michael, the youngest and most cool headed of the brothers, played as such by Al Pacino. As with Brando, you are assured career defining performances by all three men, and I don't think any of them reached these acting heights again. Equally impressive but not strictly a family member is Robert Duvall as The Don's Consilgerie, Tom Hagen. In a nutshell (if such a thing were possible) the film follows the reluctant but necessary rise of Michael to the head of The Family and his dealings with his immediate family, his wife Kay (Diane Keaton), the ranked members that protect their Family (Tessio, Clemenza, etc), other Mafia Families and corrupt  state officials. Throughout the film Michael's views on his involvement with his Family change from the events that happen to his father after The Don refuses to involve his Families resources in distributing drugs into the city. When The Don is gunned down and left for dead in the street, and Michael has his jaw broken by corrupt Police Captain McCluskey, whilst trying to protect his unguarded father in the hospital, he sets in motion the revenge killing of both McCluskey and Sollozzo, the man partly responsible for the attempt on Don Vito. The result of the ensuing incredible set piece makes it necessary for Michael to leave the country to Sicily until it is safe to return. There he experiences both happiness and tragedy, as he takes a new bride, Apollonia, and receives news that Sonny was killed for a hit he had ordered on a rival Families son in previous retribution for the hit on The Don. Sonny's death scene is itself one of the most memorable set pieces in all of cinema. When a failed attempt on Michael leaves Apollonia dead, he returns to America, cold and hardened by these terrible events. There he begins to pick up where he left his life with Kay and moves to become his fathers heir. The phrase that there is honour among thieves is nowhere more relevant than in The Godfather. Michael, Sonny, Fredo and Tom are bound together by the respect and loyalty they hold for their father (in Tom's case, unofficially adopted) and the Corleone name. Their Family will always come before anything else, as shown when Michael leaves for Sicily without much of a thought towards Kay (being both Jewish and a woman excludes her from the Family), or when Sonny rushes to his sister Connie's aid (and ultimately his demise) after she receives another vicious beating by Carlo.\n",
            "Some of the most fondly remembered and famous scenes in cinema occur throughout The Godfather. The sequence with Khartum's severed head is an undisputed classic for both the shock value and for showing us early on how far and what type of methods the Family will employ. Sonny's murder is brutal and affecting, the attempted hit on The Don is wonderfully staged with the camera looking down on the event from above, the cumulative killings of the heads of the five Families at the end is a masterpiece of editing (note to George Lucas circa Phantom Menace. This is how you direct separate climactic events that reach toward the same goal!) , and these are only some of the major events that take place. There are so many great lines that it would be fruitless to list even some of them here, as many of them are now as much a  part of the English language as any piece of classic text. What I will mention however, are the delivery on some of the lesser known phrases. When Tom has to tell The Don that `They shot Sonny on the causeway. He's dead', it's a heartbreaking moment both for himself, The Don and the audience and we can completely emphasise with their pain. The fact that we can emphasise at all with these criminals and killers is not only due to the acting, writing and directing of these characters, but that the Corleone Family is just that shade more moral and honourable than the other Families depicted in the film. When The Don calls a meeting with the heads of the five Families to clear the bad blood between them and prepare for Michael's return to America, his delivery of the line `..but I'm a superstitious man..' and subsequent warning is so powerful and commanding that nobody but Brando could have pulled it off with such weight and grandeur. When Michael asks the powerful Vegas hotel owner Moe Green that `You straightened out my brother?' the threat' is so tangible that Moe is immediately sorry and Fredo tries to make light of the situation by assuring Mike that he and Moe are best of friends. Thus begins the tragic downfall of Fredo At the beginning of the film when Michael is telling Kay about his family he assures her that `That's my family Kay, it's not me'. At the end of the film he tells her `Don't ask me about my business Kay'. Both times he is completely sincere and believable. All throughout the film there are little moments where there may not be any dialogue or anything particularly important that happens to the plot, but they made such an impression on me that I have to mention some of them. The moment when Sonny bites down on his fist so (I assume) he wouldn't swear in front of Connie when he sees the bruise marks left on her face by Carlo, gave me goosebumps. The shot of the Statue of Liberty in the backdrop after Clemenza takes Paulie out to pick up some Cannelloni and has Rocco kill him and leave him bleeding in the car. The simple shrug of The Don's eyebrows when Tom returns from meeting Jack Woltz, and the previous shot was hearing Woltz's continued screams after finding the head of his beloved horse Khartum, in his bed when he awoke. The impeccable way Michael looks, dresses and carries himself when we first see him after returning from America as he steps out of a car toward Kay, and the way Brando's face literally crumbles as he is told of Sonny's death. Every technical element in this film is of the highest level. The cinematography is beautifully composed and framed, the period designs of New York are utterly believable and we never assume we're in any other time. The music is simply stunning and perfectly highlights the mood of the characters throughout, with the main theme one of the most recognisable pieces of music in cinema. When watching this, the film simply FEELS rich. I take a great sense of importance and history from it, as though it's not merely a film but something much bigger. And there are plenty of arguments to support this, given the massive impact it has left not only on the film industry, but also on American businesses, commerce and crime. There are many stories of real life Mafiosi who base their lifestyle and way of conducting business on the Corleone way. I think the best compliment I can pay to The Godfather is that once the door is closed on Kay's face and we've both been shut out, I feel like I've witnessed an event, rather than just watch a film.\n",

            "Review 416: A very learned friend of mine once said that this was the closest film would ever come to the great operas of European legacy.  I'm not inclined to disagree.  This was the finest piece of celluloid I've ever encountered, along with 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It was tense, beautifully shot, unbelievably acted (Brando is a genius.  That's it.), and had everything else going for it that could possibly be good about a film.  Oh my.\n",

            "Review 417: Often imitated, never bettered and perhaps only equalled by \"Goodfellas\", Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" saga remains for many the greatest crime story ever put on celluloid.  Epic, sprawling, grandiose and exquisite, the Corleone story has become part of modern popular culture and has inspired a whole new mentality regarding gangsters' and the role of organised crime in modern society.  While the fabric of the real mafia has worn in recent years, \"The Godfather\" series remains the most romantic and nostalgic depiction of a society living above the law.  It's a tour-de-force for just about all involved, none more so than the director himself.Coppola had made seven unsuccessful films before he contacted author Mario Puzo, whose novel about a fictional Sicilian  American family of crime had become a best seller.  Urged on by his heritage and commitment to creating a film that would match his huge ego, Coppola sat down with Puzo (when he could pull him away from the Black Jack tables of Las Vegas and Reno) and re-wrote the story.  The result was a screenplay of supreme quality, eschewing the soap opera, meandering work of Puzo's novel for a tight, taut and fluid narrative.The legacy behind Coppola's involvement on the film belies belief when we consider how well the film turns out.  Paramount, by all accounts, despised Coppola.  Through the entire film's shooting a standby director was waiting to take over as Coppola's head was constantly on the chopping board.  It was at Coppola's insistence that Marlon Brando, who had not made a decent film for a good decade, be cast as Don Vito Corleone.  Paramount wanted Frank Sinatra.  Coppola also had to convince the studio that a young Al Pacino, 26 at the time, should play Michael Corleone, the aire to Vito.  Studio executives thought Pacino lacked depth and was too small and scrawny to play the part.  James Caan, who eventually played Sonny, was pencilled in early as Michael.  Things could have been so different.The story is based around the final years of the reign of Vito Corleone (Brando), a Sicilian immigrant who had formed a powerful empire of crime in New York.  Now a man with powerful connections in the political and legal systems, Corleone is almost untouchable.  His family consists of three sons; tough, aggressive eldest son Sonny (James Caan); weak, feeble but good-natured Fredo (John Cazale) and smart, quiet and distant Michael (Pacino).  He also has an adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), who also acts as the family's legal advisor  the Consilari.  The youngest child is daughter Connie (Talia Shire).  Sonny is next in line to take over the family business when Vito's time draws to a close, but his aggressive nature could be his undoing.  When Vito denies capital assistance to Virgil The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) for heroin trafficking, things take a downward turn.  Michael assumes the role of Don and in the process the cracks in the family empire begin to appear.  We witness the painfully slow collapse of the Corleone empire, as Michael's friends turn into enemies and the honour and code (Omerta) of the past becomes virtually non-existent.Brando was awarded the Oscar for Best Actor as Vito and it is well deserved. He is utterly convincing and memorable, despite the numerous parodies on the character.  But it is Pacino who shines as the ever-insular Michael. Starting out as idealistic war hero and ending the first film as power corrupted mafia boss, Pacino's portrayal of the youngest Corleone shifts seamlessly along.  Pacino is at his best when his character is faced with a personal dilemma, not one associated with business'. \n",
            "Of course the entire cast is brilliant.  James Caan commands the first third of the film as Sonny.  He is pure aggression, an old school tough guy who acts first and thinks later.  Robert Duvall is solid as Hagen and is at his best in the early scenes involving studio hotshot Jack Woltz (John Morley). Diane Keaton is excellent as Kaye Adams, the WASP whose life is changed forever when she agrees to marry Michael.  In the limited screentime allocated to her character Keaton gives it her all and is a far cry from the characters she became associated with in her Woody Allen films.  Other actors of note include Richard Castellano as Capo Regime Peter Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio, Richard Conte as Don Barzini and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop Captain McKluskey.  Even the minor characters in the film are memorable.The production design by Dean Tavoularis is exquisite.  The Don's den is brilliantly lit, or more so unlit.  It consumes its inhabitants in the shadows, and the Don himself moves with stealth around his cavernous headquarters.  Complementing the design is the brilliant cinematography by Gordon Willis.  The film is shot with a soft yellow filter, giving it an aged feel.  When the film relocates to Sicily, Willis opens up the screen and fills it with breathtaking surroundings and the quaint, quiet environment of the tiny villages where the saga all began.  Then when the film returns to the United States and Michael begins his ascendancy to the upper-echelons of power, Willis turns down the colour and presents Michael as an almost dead character, stripped of life and feeling.  It's a great touch and is best emphasised when Michael woos Kaye, albeit without an inkling of charm, back into his life.  He gestures Kaye towards the car, which resembles a Hearse more than a limo and her life in his downward spiral begins.\"The Godfather\" smashed all box office records before it and spawned the blockbuster': one film from one studio that would be able to crush any of its opponents.  The film took home three Oscars, including Best Picture, Director, Actor (rejected by Brando) and Screenplay from Previously Published material.  With Coppola now on top and Paramount in his corner the stage was set for the next chapter in the saga.  But that's another story altogether\n",

            "Review 418: Having only been born 14 years after the release of The Godfather, I don't know if audiences at the time realised just how influential the film would become in later years. It has been homaged, parodied and copied so much - Don Corleone's husky voice and prominent chin especially - that it's a miracle it's managed to hold onto its status as one of the finest pictures Hollywood has ever produced. It's also rather astonishing that the film was ever made at all, given the troubled production amidst a meddling Paramount (who pretty much held a gun to director Francis Ford Coppola's head throughout). But watching it again, 41 years after it was made, it's just as beautiful and thrilling as it was when I first saw it.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the Sicilian head of the Corleone crime family. His eldest son Sonny (James Caan) is his short-tempered and hot-headed heir, the polar opposite to the youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who is college-educated and has just returned from serving in World War II. When the Don refuses an offer to invest in the booming drugs trade by drug baron Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo (Al Lettieri) - who is backed by Corleone rivals the Tattaglia's - he is gunned down and almost killed. With his father in hospital and still in danger, Michael finds himself slowly being drawn into the family business he vowed to stay away from.Head of Paramount at the time Bob Evans said he wanted to \"smell the spaghetti\" and hired the relatively inexperienced Coppola, who is of Sicilian heritage, to direct the film, in order to give the film authenticity. From the opening scene, it is evident that the gamble paid off. The wedding of the Don's daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), is a textbook guide on how to introduce characters to an audience. This long, gorgeous segment of the film establishes the Corleone's sense of family importance. They are all cold-blooded killers, perhaps, but they are loyal and have a code. It's also fascinating to see the hierarchy within organised crime, something that seems embedded into our conscience now after countless films involving 'made' men and capo's.But it's a combination of many elements that makes The Godfather so great. The patient, controlled approach, Coppola and novel author Mario Puzo's celebrated, Oscar-winning screenplay, Nino Rota's powerful score, the subtle dark comedy (\"leave the gun, take the cannoli\") the magnificent set-pieces (Michael searching for the gun in the cafe restroom is still nerve-jangling) , and perhaps most of all, the acting talent on display. Brando, Pacino and Robert Duvall (as adopted son and consigliere Tom Hagen) can boast career-defining performances from the picture, and can celebrate film careers spanning decades and countless awards. There's little I can say about The Godfather that hasn't already been said, but this is one of the true undisputed classics of American cinema.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com\n",

            "Review 419: The year was 1972. Francis Ford Coppola was in the beginning of this career, and he was only in the process of proving himself as a director. Little did he know, that he was going to direct a movie which would go down as possibly THE most beloved and acclaimed film of all time. The movie was \"The Godfather\". It became the highest grossing film of the year 1972, and of all time (in 1972)! It won 3 Oscars: Best Actor (Marlon Brando), Best Adapted Screenplay (Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola) and Best Picture (Albert S. Ruddy). Unfortunately, Coppola did not take home the gold for directing, nor did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall or James Caan for their brilliant supporting roles! But Oscars really doesn't matter, the movie still stands as a piece of cinematic brilliance! The Godfather tells a relatively simple tale: Michael Corleone (Pacino) is son of the powerful mafia don Vito Corleone (Brando). Michael recently returned from the WW2, and he wants nothing to do with the \"family business\". Vito doesn't want that either, but after a chain of events, Michael is forced to rise as the new family don, in order to protect his family and allies from downfall. The movie doesn't pretend to be something it isn't. It's a simple plot, it's one we can all understand and it's still en epic gangster movie! And that's the other thing about the film: it's very epic in scope! All the locations, all the props, all the actors, etc. It all comes together to create something magical! Al Pacino keys in an amazing performance as Michael, the son who must protect his family! At first eye-drop one could call his performance \"low-key\". But it's merely an observation of the characters calmness, subtlety and his cold nature, that transforms into a calculating, ruthless and chilling persona. Apparently, Pacino approached the role with this thought. For my money, this was an Academy Award-worthy performance. Marlon Brando is equally impressing as Vito Corelone. His performance is calm, determined and calculated. But Brando doesn't only present Vito Corleone as a cliché ruthless mafioso don, but also as a father that loves his family, and that the audience can admire and care for. Robert Duvall, James Caan, Talia Shire, John Gazale and Diane Keaton is also presented as capable and great characters! Everyone gets tons of character development, and their performances are spectacular!Nino Rota's haunting score perfectly illustrates what kind of film we're dealing with here, and every time you hear it the score feels new and epic! This has got to be one of the most memorable film scores of all time! The cinematography is beautiful, the sound is fantastic and overall The Godfather is a truly beautiful film to admire! Puzo and Coppola's screenplay is brilliant and filled with memorable lines: \"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\", \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\" and \"It's not personal Sonny, it's strictly business\". Francis Ford Coppola truly captures the feeling of a spaghetti gangster movie, and his direction is brilliant, tireless and visible in every scene! Twentieth Century Fox wanted to replace him several times during production, but thankfully they didn't! He was robbed an Oscar!The Godfather is a movie that will never grow old, and we will be able to watch if for many years to come! It always feels fresh and exiting every time you watch it! From the first monologue by Bonasera, to the last shot of Michael Corleone as the new don, this movie leaves you shattered by the perfection. Saying The Godfather is a perfect movie, is like saying Chuck Norris is badass. See my point? A must-watch for everyone! 10/10\n",

            "Review 420: This is a trilogy that has Al Pacino as Michael Corleone in each one but in this film he goes from the nice, innocent boy in love who has a great respect for his father (Marlon Brando) to the leader of the family. THE DON. His transformation shows how amazing Pacino is as an actor. Him and De Niro who I consider the greatest two actors in the last 40 years both rules the 70s, they prove it again in the sequel that I don't find quite as good as the original, even though MANY people think that this is the one time the sequel finally surpasses the original in the Godfather Series.I do not.I think this first Godfather is leaps ahead of the rest, not exactly leaps maybe in front of the second but most definitely the third.While I like Heat and Goodfellas more then the Godfather I think this is a perfect 10 out of 10 for everything. The morals, the messages, the family values, the acting, the story, the action, the characters, everything in this film is flawless.This movie is one you need to be in the mood to watch due to the length and its time, but you feel slick after watching so many performances.This what film-making is all about.This is Cinema.One of the greatest movies ever made and it will be like that for years to come.A movie that will never be forgotten.A movie....you just cant refuse!10.\n",

Goodfellas comes pretty close, but The Godfather and Godfather II are the mold that Goodfellas was made from.I first saw this film in 1983, 11 years after it was released.  I'd heard about it, but VCRs weren't quite common household items back then.  I had a cinema class in high school, and to view this film, the teachers got us out of all our classes for a day and showed The Godfather on the big screen in the school auditorium.  So I was fortunate to see it for the first time in a crowded theatre on a big screen.Afterwards, the entire class asked for the movie to be shown again in place of one of the other films we were due to see.  They offered to play it after school in the evening for us instead.  The whole class turned out the second time plus another 100 to 150 tag-alongs.This movie is full of fantastic performances from top to bottom. To try to convey how great this film is in words is almost silly.  It has to be seen.\n",

But I truly do not see No. 1 or No. 3. I really can't place my finger on it, and perhaps another viewing on a better-quality tape will help, but it seems to me that The Godfather's hype has gotten to the point where enjoyment of the movie is starting to be flawed because of it. 9.5/10\n",

            "Review 423: I saw this movie because of my father's recommendation. It was just a dramatical movie at first. The perfect revenge and the movie which is for all of gangsters. But, when I saw this movie again, I felt some other parts. Widely, there are two themes in the movie; one is about American dream and the other one is about many life of mafia. The last son of Don Colione, Michael doesn't want to join his father's business. But, after Don got hurt by other mafia's gangsters, the Don family came to be in danger. He couldn't help but assist them. And he finally realized his destiny and his family's fate. He became the leader of the family. He was as good as his father and his cruelty was better than his father. Finally, he became the best godfather in the mafia and he lost his old shape. Michael's father, Vito shows American dream's reality in the movie. Before he dies, he grows many vegetables that he wanted. He wanted to live normally, but he became a gangster as if his son. For his death and Michael's victory between family fighting, the movie continues the darkness of the society and bad side of American dream.\n",

Castellano, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, John Marley. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola.Spoilers herein.I don't think in all my viewings of movies have I seen such excellent direction, acting and writing. \"The Godfather\" is so brilliant in almost every way that I don't see how anyone could NOT call it a masterpiece. Michael Corleone, one of three sons of his mob boss father Don Vito, returns home from the war for his sister's wedding. Soon after his return, Don Corleone is wounded in a mob hit and Michael wants to strike back. Michael eliminates a corrupt cop and a competing mafioso in public, and escapes to Sicily. While Michael is gone, the Corleone family begins to fall apart.Marlon Brando gives a powerful and influential performance that is the best of his career with the exception of \"Last Tango in Paris\". Al Pacino also does very well, and he continues to do so in the later two installments of the trilogy. James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also give great performances for the supporting characters. Coppola is smart with the directing as he doesn't make the film necessarily about shootouts or pure murders, though there is a big amount of violence, but instead he shows how it affects the people who have something to do with them. It is a series of \"family\" events that build up to a devastating ending. Nino Rota's eerie score highly adds to the atmosphere of the film.This film, it's sequel and \"Apocalypse Now\" were the only true modern classics that Coppola made, and launched the careers of Al Pacino and Diane Keaton, two of Hollywood's finest actors and two of my favorites. It is everything that films like \"Scarface (1983)\" tried to be and should have been, and without this film I doubt that \"Once Upon a Time in America\", \"Goodfellas\", \"The Untouchables\" and many others would have ever been made. \"The Godfather\" is the definite great film that should be viewed by anyone who calls themselves a cinematic movie buff. 5 stars out of 5.\n",

            "Review 429: Taking the old-fashioned gangster film to new heights, The Godfather used traditional story-telling freed from the strict censorship that meant bad guys always got their come-uppance. More film noir than thriller, there are no good guys, and we meditate on the small rays of hope within the darkness of corruption, or wonder how far our good and pleasant lifestyles are supported, at some level, by corruption.In dark, Rembrandt-like backrooms, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) and his family grant favours, blessings, and generally run things for their friends out in the real, bright and beautiful world. A bride's father traditionally grants any wish, and petitions come from far and wide as Don Corleone's daughter has a colourful wedding celebration outside.It's 1945. Things are changing. Narcotics is the big new industry that beckons temptingly, and one in which the other mafia families have already started. Don Corleone is cautious, but his competitors are envious of the control he has over the police and the judges and want him in. Before long, bloody warfare between the gangs ensues.The Godfather continually contrasts dark and light, external show with violent murky depths, and the devoutness of the gangsters is emphasised. One sequence has a scene of a family baptism intercut with brutal killings ordered by the head of the gang (who is in church). Further similarities to the Roman Catholic Spanish Inquisition might be inferred from a scene immediately afterwards where a confession is obtained from a double-crossing gang member - he is promised redemption but executed anyway.The double nature of the main characters is convincingly emphasised as we watch Don Corleone play with his grandson in the garden, or his successor Michael (Al Pacino) enjoy the idyllic countryside of Sicily. It is taken to a new level when, in a different situation, he tells a blatant lie compellingly and lovingly to his wife so she doesn't think him a murderer. His gentleness goes hand in hand with his brutal nature.The Godfather catapulted the career of the young Francis Coppola and revitalised the career of Marlon Brando. A masterpiece of restrained film-making, its biggest fault may be that there are so many characters and details to absorb in the complex family plots for a first viewing.In a conference over whether to deal in narcotics, one of the arguments that sways the day is that if they don't control them, someone else will step in and do so. By dealing in narcotics at the most powerful level, they can keep them away from children. An argument that should perhaps be given greater consideration by legislators.If anyone has ever made you 'an offer you couldn't refuse', this is the film that created and popularised the phrase. It was meant quite literally.\n",

            "Review 430: Most critics say it's Citizen Kane. Someone mentions Casablanca. Most people in the world, though, think Francis Ford Coppola's gangster story The Godfather is the finest film ever made. It is a tough one to call, and even if I have to say I prefer Casablanca, Coppola's crime opus is a very close runner-up, its greatness being untarnished after all these years. This epic masterpiece takes place in New York, early '50s. It begins with an ever memorable scene: Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) listens to complaints from one of his associates and, while stroking his cat, accepts to do this man a favor. It's something which reoccurs during the day, since it's part of any Sicilian's code of honor not to refuse any favor on his daughter's wedding day. And whenever asked to do something about any problem, the Don makes \"offers that can't be refused\". It's that kind of attitude which has brought him where he is currently: at the top of the Mafia's power chain. He controls all illegal business in the whole state, and he's ably supported by his lawyer, and adopted son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and two of his biological off-springs, the passionate Santino aka Sonny (James Caan) and the more rational Michael (Al Pacino). The latter is actually a bit reluctant to be involved with the family business, but when other families start attempting on his father's life, he's forced to help his mother and brothers restore order in town.What I've just summed up isn't but a small part of the film (it's almost three hours long, and I've described approximately the first 30 minutes), which is also partially set in Sicily. The Italian segment is the most poetic and romantic in the entire film, as we witness Michael's first dealings with true love. How come he's in Sicily at some point in the film, I can't reveal. But let me assure you, you'll definitely want to visit those places once you've seen the film. The landscape is a visual delight, and Nino Rota's score contributes a lot to making the movie in its entirety an unmissable gem.Since The Godfather deals with organized crime, however, it can't be all pretty countryside and romantic moments. Once you have absolute power, you have to fight in order to preserve it, and that's gonna require quite some violence. Don Vito knows this like no one else, and Michael will learn the lesson when it comes to him to run the family.That's an important theme: family. Behind all its brutality, The Godfather is a remarkable example of how important your own flesh and blood is. It's probably not a coincidence that the film opens with a wedding, when the entire Corleone dynasty is united, and that one of the Top 10 sequences is the one where, during a break from everything underworld-related, Clemenza (Richard Castellano) teaches Michael how to cook pasta sauce, only to be interrupted by Sonny. It's a funny and simple scene, and maybe that's why people still have fond memories of it.Coppola has made a magnificent Italian-American tragedy, perfectly written, directed and most of all acted. Where would much of the movie's greatness be without Brando's immortal, Oscar-winning patriarch? And what about Pacino, Caan and Duvall, all nominated for their fundamental contributions? It's largely thanks to them that The Godfather remains the gangster opus to top them all.\n",

I thought that it would be a great movie with a plot that would be interesting, characters that I could relate to and give me some form of entertainment during the course of the movie, but boy was I wrong.I was pretty much bored from the start to the end of the movie and the only reason why I kept watching was because I thought to myself \"This is a movie everyone must have seen during their lifetime\". It even took me two days to watch it because I was so bored that I paused the movie and went to bed and continued to watch it the day after and was still just as bored.The acting was okay at best and I felt that the actors could have done better but failed to do so, and the director failed to even get me interested in the characters. When some of the characters die I didn't care one bit, not once did I care. They could have killed everyone in the movie and I wouldn't care at all because I could not relate to anything of the characters persona.Due to the lack of character-interest I didn't get interested in the plot at all and it felt like I was dragged through the whole movie with a barbwire around my neck.Today I plan to get dragged once more when I'm going to watch The Godfather 2 and if it's anything like the first one it's going to be a horrible experience.\n",

            "Review 435: This type of movies which you get to watch over and over again without getting bored of it, they way it has been scripted, acted, produced and directed is really attractive and amazingly catching your breath, it has a lot of life lessons to learn from no matter what do you do in your life, it also shows the importance of family bonding and keeping it all balanced. I'm convinced that I will never ever get to watch a similar movie to this one with this brilliance in every aspect, I don't even believe that if there would be anyone on this earth who has never saw the Godfather Trilogy, it is absolutely highly recommended, but of course its not suitable for the little kids, it has lots of violent scenes, hopefully we'll get to see more and more of these awesome titles.\n",

All the actors did their best, which actually result in memorable performances. Marlon Brando was excellent. Regardless of the fact that The Godfather was one of his first movies Al Pacino was very good. The Godfather is one of the movies that make me love the cinema.\n",

I think this is just another one of those cases where everyone's convinced themselves it's so great only because the pretentious critics told us it is, and you're so afraid of being considered a philistine that you go along with it, telling yourself, yeah, this really is a masterpiece, even though you were bored by it too.The movie's pretty boring. None of the characters are likeable. All the big moments of the movie build up to nothing more than \"Let's shoot him\" and then they do. That's it. That's all that keeps happening throughout the movie, in between long drawn out dialogue scenes. And the story's not even told very well - so many long conversations that don't really convey anything of any significance; so much pointless stuff happens that doesn't really add to anything to the plot.The movie dumps like 20 characters onto us all at once at the wedding scene at the beginning of the movie and then expects us to keep up with which Italian guy is which for the rest of the 3 hours. I constantly had to pause it to search on the Internet for their names to figure out who they're talking about, which ones are Al Pacino's brothers, which of them are family, which are his in-laws, who is not related to the family, who works for the old man, who works for the rival families, etc.I'll give this film 1/10, not because it's quite that bad, but because it's been severely overrated and deserves to drop down a few stars.The one good thing here is the music is good, I'll give it that.\n",

            "Review 441: This is one of the greatest films ever made. Any doubt about that can be dispelled by watching the movie. I missed this when it first came out, and then a curious thing happened. For some reason I thought I had seen the film. One decade and then two went by and I kept hearing what a great film The Godfather was. But I was unimpressed because I thought I had seen it.I don't know what film I had seen, but it wasn't The Godfather. Seeing this film for the first time over thirty years after the fact of its production is a startling experience. The Godfather is a work of art from first scene to last. There is the most amazing adherence to that fiction which is truer than fact.I would like to say that I played cards with Mario Puzo who wrote the novel from which the film was adapted and who famously worked with Coppola on the screenplay, but in fact I only played cards with some people who had played cards with Puzo. Ah, such is the effect of celebrity. Puzo became like Coppola something of a legend after this film was produced, and everybody suddenly knew him or played cards with him. Everybody, from the most unsophisticated celluloid fan to the most erudite and jaded critic had walked out of that theater after 171 minutes mesmerized and delighted and emotionally moved by an uncompromising look at not just a Mafia family, but the psychology of families since time immemorial. The truth that we have all lived and experienced was made large on the screen in the form of the Corleones. I can guarantee you that audiences from every culture on the planet would understand the underlying psychology of this movie and take it to some serious extent as their own.Marlon Brando plays the godfather (the patriarch, of course, or even the warlord if you like) of the past and the present, and then, as must always be the case, comes a new godfather. What is fascinating is who this new godfather is and how he comes to power. The ending of the film is--after so many brilliant scenes and so many psychologically true surprises and so many excursions to Queens and the Bronx and Sicily and Las Vegas (each vignette absolutely integrated into the story of the film)--even more ponderously true and a surprise that sneaks up on us so stealthily that it is not a surprise. And when the credits begin to run after Diana Keaton's tears of realization, we too realize the \"message\" of the film. It is a message that I think would be understood in the Middle East today (and two thousand years ago as well) as I write this, a message of tribal ways and the rise and fall of warlords and the Machiavellian machinations of the prince who would be king.But it is Al Pacino's performance as the son of the godfather that in the final analysis steals the show as he goes from the intellectual boy who would be a legitimate American success at the finest colleges, etc. to a man wearing the hat of Al Capone. And Pacino makes us believe every step of the way.Well, I should not say that it Al Pacino who steals the show. In truth this is Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. He would not have the film he has without Al Pacino or Marlon Brandon and certainly not without the novel and script from Mario Puzo, of course; but make no mistake about it. Coppola manicured every scene. He attended to every detail, from the color of the wine to the tires on the cars to the dances and the music to the villas abroad to the sleaze of Las Vegas to the perfect casting of the main characters right down to the extras including both cute and not so cute kids, as indeed life would give us. In some very real sense Coppola lived this movie and it was a part of him, and yet I am stuck by the fact that Puzo invented it.This is an American classic, an uncompromising work of art that engages, informs and moves the audience--just about any audience--to ask the great questions regarding who we are and what we should do and how we should live.From the wedding to the funeral to the christening to the priest in Latin voice-over as the final vengeance is planned to that final vengeance (that we know will NOT be the final vengeance), we are glued to our seats as the life of human beings (who could very well be us) passes before our transfixed eyes.Oscars went to Brando as best actor, and to Puzo and Coppola for best screen adaptation. In a rare show of almost universal agreement among movie goers, critics, and the Academy, The Godfather won the Oscar as Best Picture in 1972.Don't miss this as I had for so long, and see it for Coppola who can take his place among the greats of all cinema for this film alone.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)\n",

            "Review 442: I have had a distinct pleasure to have watched this picture for the first time in a 35mm screen this year in a cinema in London that shows classic films. I refrained from watching it years ago in my teenage years because my ignorant past thought this film was overrated, but honestly, there is no possible word or expression that can describe how wrong I was. The cinematography of this picture is so unheard of and monumental that every frame of this picture looks like something that could be hung as a painting in a museum. The story brings with it elements of something that came out of a Shakespearean Tragedy. I have watched it 7 times or more in a short time, and it takes A LOT to make me watch a film for a second time, let alone 7. It is one of, if not my favorite film of all time. If human civilization were to go extinct, this should be one of the few pieces of art that must survive for future intelligent lifeforms to discover and marvel at.\n",

            "Review 443: It has been over three decades since its birth, yet *The Godfather* reigns as the yardstick by which all other gangster movies are brutally scrutinized.Only twice has its proprietary mien been challenged - with Scorcese's gutshock *Goodfellas* in 1990 and David Chase's superlative *The Sopranos* in 1999. Everything else runs a far, far fourth behind these juggernauts.From Mario Puzo's book of the same name, Francis Ford Coppolla directs the legendary story of an East Coast crime lord, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in the eponymous role), grooming his eldest son, Santino \"Sonny\" (James Caan) to take over the Family Business, that being, one arm of the Italian \"Five Families\" who run the Eastern seaboard's organized crime. When Sonny is brutally gunned down in an inter-familial dispute, Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), who sought a life removed from the Family's \"business,\" ultimately discovers his familial and business instincts and steps into the breach to take the reins.Like the movie itself, its characters have weathered the three decades to become icons by which all other movie gangsters are measured; most of the actors in these staggering roles never quite shaking off the specter of their characters  which will surely haunt them far past their own deaths.These archetypes have become so ingrained in our culture that it is almost impossible to think back to a time when they did not exist; like trying to imagine a world before *Smoke On The Water*, or *Star Wars.* Very simply, if not for *The Godfather* these archetypes would not be archetypes. The movie actually influenced real crime families with its new street vernacular (\"Make him an offer he can't refuse\") and manner of conducting \"business\" (that of regarding any means to achieve an end as honorable  as long as the good of The Family was invoked).The greatest gift *The Godfather* bequeathed the movie-going public was its unapologetic stance on anti-social behavior. Beyond \"Man with No Name\" protocol  where a lone stranger would operate by his own rules, disregarding anyone else's well-being for his own ends - here was a FAMILY, an organized para-militia of sociopaths who followed principles wildly at odds with \"normal\" society's. Yet Puzo, Coppolla and actors boldly offer no excuses as to their characters' existence, motives or actions. After our Gangster 101 schooling with James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, here was a blood-driven, wealth-engined world only hinted at in those previous gangster genre movies, now fleshed out almost against our will; here was a world where our societal notions of right and wrong were utterly reversed, yet which made sense in the verisimilitude of its own universe.Searing with grand irony, the first line of dialog in *The Godfather* is, \"I believe in America.\" And indeed, these characters are not mindless convenience store hijack artists  they are businessmen in the truest sense of the word. They are also imbued with a strong sense of loyalty and justice. Though *The Godfather* may seem apologist in its stance towards supposedly heartless criminals, telling the tale from *their* point of view allows us freedom from guilt when we realize that \"crime\" is a subjective term. As Don Corleone states, when opting not to murder molesters, but rather land them in hospital like their victim, \"We're not murderers.\" No matter they dabbled in gambling, prostitution, money-laundering and murder, they sought only to be self-sufficient, to keep their families well, and to live comfortably in peace - otherwise called The American Dream.In setting the tale in the 1940s, Puzo and Coppolla removed us from everyday reality from the outset; in this insular universe we readily accepted The Family's version of morality. It was no stretch to dovetail the authorities' actions in the film with our suspected perception of them in our reality. Matter of fact, it seemed to vindicate our darkest suspicions that the people whom we place our unmitigated trust in for safety from society's savage shadow dwellers are in cahoots with those very shadow dwellers who are trying to subvert our safety.There are scenes that will be burned forever into your mind's movie wall: the opening tableau of the Godfather presiding at his desk; the head of racehorse Khartoum in Jack Woltz's bed; Michael gunning down the police captain; Carlo Rizzo being bitch-whipped by Sonny; the slaying of Sonny; even seemingly-benign scenes like Moe Greene's meeting with Michael, where he claps his hands together and exclaims, \"You goddam guineas really make me laugh!\"  the subsequent bullet through his eye is another mind-burner; and the grand \"cleansing\"  scenes of the East Coast bosses being killed systematically juxtaposed over Michael renouncing Satan at his god-daughter's baptism Through it all runs the unbreakable thread of Family. The opening wedding scene ends on a poignant note of a father dancing with his daughter. Harking back to the familial theme constantly, Coppolla reaffirms our deepest vicarious desires. We are all immigrants to some extent, the bonds of our heritages displaced, fragmented, growing weaker over every generation of X-Box and internet junkies; there seems nothing that can bind the strands of our familial threads. We find affinity in the blood bonds of *The Godfather*, on some level deeper than the span of oceans and the passage of time.(Movie Maniacs, visit: poffysmoviemania.com)\n",

            "Review 444: This film follows Vito Corleone the leader of a New York Mafia called 'family' having to deal with the consequences of ether moving with the times and going into drug related crime or sticking to the traditional old country ways of gambling. This effects his war hero son Michael who has no intentions into going into the family business.The Godfather is the best gangster/mobster movie ever made in my opinion. Its simply phenomenal. There's not much I didn't love in this movie a few things that were a bit dated but made the film even more enjoyable to watch. The acting in this film is fantastic by everyone not just the main gangsters like Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) who brings a chilling confidence in everything he dose now its one of the most iconic performances in cinematic history and it shows, its really good to watch. Same goes for Al Pacino as Michael Corleone he was just gripping to watch to see him slowly change from an good guy war hero to a ruthless mafia leader you completely gets you engrossed. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen was brilliant too, always in the background ready to give helpful advice whenever needed one of my favourites and a really interesting character to watch. Then the less main characters like Talia Shire was amazing in this film she really played her part well. I could go on about each actor in this film but I won't there's just some of the standout performances in this film and I can assure you their are more. The directing still to this day is brilliant to watch its simple but very elegant. The script is for me one of the best written in movie history its got some of the most iconic lines every scripted and to have such talented actors its no wonder this film is so popular. The soundtrack again is so memorable at times it brings chills down your spine with thrill and excitement knowing something truly awesome is about to happen. The only thing I thought was a bit dated was just in one scene when Michaels brother Sonny Corleone played very well by James Caan where he is fighting his sisters husband for beating her and you can clearly see he's miles away from touching him. Like I said tho this just makes this film that bit more fun to watch. Overall this film has some of the best overall acting you are likely to see, some of the most iconic script and music you are likely to hear too. Its a must see for any movie movie watcher, a timeless classic and I hear Part two is even better!\n",

            "Review 446: There's so many perfect executed scenes through The Godfather that it can be easy to underrate how nicely shaped the movie is, sometimes too overblown in that Coppola manner, but the transition between generations and with that capitalist periods is achieved with the precision.The movie is at its best when it goes all in its notions of tribalism and how they contrast with Pacino's Michael for whom so much of it is mere an easy excuse, his disconnect from his family beyond an ideal (outside of those scenes after his dad gets shot even those have a performative dutiful quality) give the movie most of its emotional stakes. Blood relations justifies murder and by the end that's really the only function it has.Duvall probably gives the movie most all-around performance because he is the only for who the mantra \"it's just business\" really applies, Coppola strains a lot to make the movie large political observations, but they most work on his scenes as he has such a solid mix of people pleasing skills keeping everyone relaxed and constant annoyance that the work has to deal with so much gangland hits and horse beheadings. My favorite bit about the film climax is his final scene with Vigoda because the latter sells the desperation that plays strong against Duvall's annoyance that the matter must be dealt at all, it is no coincidence Coppola treats it as a privileged moment in the middle of fireworks effects that dominate Michael's large vendetta.I must say I don't particular care for the movie final scenes, it mostly seems to die alongside Brando, not because he is the center or even the main attraction, but after that it seems happy with just performing Michael supposedly damnation and the scenes that related to that are the movie phoniest parts, it would take part III for any of Michael's damnation to achieve some human dimension beyond a rhetorical gambit that lets the audience more off the hook. Pacino's performance is at his best when it is clearly the Michael gets a kick of power and as a whole The Godfather is less about America or capital than it is about corruption and how seductive and awesome it truly is (one might of course argue all these three things are inseparable in Coppola's conception, but one of them take primary interest).I'm less crazy about Coppola's Viscontian aspirations than most, but The Godfather do get a lot of its shifting between the grandiose operatic nature and the smaller bits of business that give it foundation like Michael desperation trying to get the gun or even better the baker tension at playing bodyguard a bit early or the split second Fredo understands Michael is really there to make his Vegas vacation over.My favorite Brando bit in the movie is his scenes with Lattieri and I think it is mostly how Lattieri is the only actor who treats the movie as pure pulp so he gives Brando a different energy to bounce off. Their scene is about contrasting ideologies on the business, but it exists completely on the moment as a very specific thing and not discourse and that gets through some of Brando more mannered tics. By the same token, I love Sonny's execution or earlier his beatdown of Carlo because they seem like they could come from an Italian Godfather knockoff from two earlier later, I don't think the movie would be half as memorable if it was all like that, but I do think it would also be much worse if Coppola's just settle for the Hollywood wannabe arthouse film that it often gets praised as, the body of the gangster flick remains there and a lot of thrills are cheap.That's also probably why the thing I take the most out of The Godfather are the parade of character actor faces just going through their beats, the fading stars like Conte or Hayden who are there for their associations, but all those less well known Italian American guys (Castellano, Vigoda, Lattieri, Rocco, even Cazale who really gets surprising little to do, but who every reaction seems perfect).\n",

            "Review 449: SPOILERSFor the sake of a personal confession, this review of the Godfather is not as neutral and objective as it should be. For that I apologise, but with good reason.In August 2003, after watching \"The Godfather\" in what I assume now must have been a tired state, I condemned and criticised this film for being overrated, drawn out and dull. Today on the eighth of July 2004, I apologise for such a flawed review. \"The Godfather\", whilst still perhaps not worthy of it's number one slot, is one of the best films ever created.In this film, we are introduced to the Corleone family. The story starts at the wedding of Connie Corleone to Carlo Rizzi. As is tradition amongst Sicillian families, Connie's father, The Godfather, Don Vito Corleone hands out favours to those who respectfully ask for his help. At the wedding as well are the Don's other children, Fredo (John Cazale), the violent Sonny (James Caan) and the youngest, the war hero, Michael (Al Pacino). Over two and a half hours of film later and the lives of Vito and his family are changed forever as this one Gangland family fights with external and internal problems.\"The Godfather\" is a beautiful piece of cinema. With the late Marlon Brando putting in a fine performance as Vito, the film had a figurehead character. Ultimately however, it is Al Pacino who deserves most praise. Rarely can there be shown in a film such a dramatic change in a character over such a space of time. Going from a law abiding war hero returning from the Second World War with medals and a beautiful wife, Pacino's Michael gradually changes in appearance and style as he takes his place at the head of the family. Everything about him is designed to show the change in his character. His hair changes style, his clothes change style, even his face changes mannerisms (although partly due to his jaw being broken by a corrupt police chief). Pacino as Michael demonstrates just how truely awesome an actor he is.The acting alone is not just what makes this film great. The way in which characters are added and removed from the story is clever. Nobody is too good a character to be written out and everybody is given a chance to play a key role in the events.The musical direction of \"The Godfather\" is another part of it's beauty. As well as the obvious piece of music which everyone is aware of, the ways in which sound is used to keep our attention at times is superb. The background music and the location from Michael's time in Italy is beautiful. All in all, there's nothing which can be faulted.When I originally wrote a review for this film last year, I complained of how it was overrated and dull, that is a mistake I now regret. \"The Godfather\" is a beautiful film that I might not necessarily place at number one in the internet movie database all time list, but which I can see why it is there. This film is a piece which everyone should be forced to watch and a piece which, if they pay attention to it, they will love.\n",

            "Review 451: The Godfather is an insightful sociological study of violence, power, honor and obligation, corruption, justice and crime in America. Part I of The Godfather Trilogy centers on the Corleone crime \"family\" in the boroughs of New York City in the mid 1940s, dominated at first by aging godfather/patriarch \"Don\" Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando in a tremendous, award-winning acting portrayal that revived his career). A turn-of-the-century Silician immigrant, he is the head of one of the five Italian-American \"families\" that operates a crime syndicate. The 'honorable' crime \"family,\" working outside the system due to exclusion by social prejudice, serves as a metaphor for the way business (the pursuit of the American dream) is conducted in capitalistic, profit-making corporations and governmental circles.This epic story traces the history of their close-knit Mafia family and organization over a ten year period (although the specific words \"Mafia\" and \"Cosa Nostra\" are not found in the film's script - they were replaced with \"the family\"). The presiding, dominant Corleone patriarch, who is threatened by the rise of modern criminal activities - the drug trade, is ultimately succeeded by his decent youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), a US Marine Corps officer in WWII who becomes even more ruthless to persist. Family loyalty and blood ties are juxtaposed with brutal and vengeful blood-letting and the inevitable downfall of the family. Romanticized scenes of the domestic home life of members of the family - a family wedding, shopping, a baptism, kitchen cooking, etc., are intertwined with scenes of horrific violence and murder contracts - a total of 23 deaths litter the film. Over 50 scenes involved food and drink.\n",

The only thing that could make it a classic is the quality of the actors that were hired - and while the actors themselves can and have made quality movies, this one just doesn't do it for me.  Brando didn't impress me in the least in this movie.And as for the portrayal of organized crime - nothing personal, but if you find it attractive to honor men who not just break the law but flout the laws of civilization, then more power to you.  Crime and criminals aren't glamorous - they're a sore on the backside of humanity that should be expunged.\n",

That the actors are very well. The problem is that it does not catch me. He can not hook me. When it seems that it is going to put interesting Al Pacino goes away of trip and does things that do not make sense and that do not come to story.The photography is spectacular, such as art, makeup, costumes, the overall setting is fine. The actors also do very well.The management however, although it takes well the tone, but is that to my Coppola I do not like, I am sorry, but I do not like how it directs. He can not catch me in any way. Neither with history nor with beauty, which does not exist, nor with plans. I do not like anything that is a film shot basically in the foreground. Of course it has open plans, but all the conversations are in the foreground, there is nothing staging. The character of Al Pacino seems totally inconsistent to me, as soon as it says white makes black. It is the most variable character of the whole cast.Yet this is the best of the three, because the two is worse and the three is worse still in every way.\n",

Other scenes, particularly where their is action or violence, seem dated. On the plus side, Brando gives a mostly fascinating performance, and some of the supporting actors are also quite good. I especially liked Robert Duvall and Abe Vigoda. Apart from the acting, their is one section of the film that I did find riveting. It is when they prepare Michael to kill The Turk and the police chief. It is tense and suspenseful, and is the closest the movie comes to noir.\n",

            "Review 457: The Cordleone family is modeled on a Mafia family which existed. The Mario Puzo novel was highly fictionalized & made for an interesting premise. The classic line from this film \"I'm going to make them an offer they can't refuse,\" has become the most cliché line ever uttered from a film.Marlon Brando was well suited for his role in this plodding drama. The 2008 restoration of the Godfather by Copola on DVD brings this film, not only back to original form but even better. The set available now has all 3 films plus extras. When I watched to original now restored, I realized just how great this movie is.This film takes it time telling it's story and it is much more classic story telling over action. The restoration makes the dark film play much better than older prints I have seen before. It is in 5 speaker sound for home theater systems. After seeing how good this original is, I am looking foreword to checking out 2 & 3.James Caan, Abe Vigoda head a stellar list of folks supporting Brando here with incredible acting by Al Pacino as the son heir apparent. There is plenty of reason to watch this restored version. It is done with an obvious flair and once you watch this, you easily forget HBO's poor relative, The Sopranos. If they face Brando, they wouldn't last 5 minutes.\n",

            "Review 458: I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind. After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, Kirk Douglas, Vincent Gardenia, Burt Lancaster, Anthony Franciosa, Joseph Calleia, John Marley, or Ben Gazzara cast? Any of them would have been more menacing, more Italian, and had a more commanding presence. Most of these men made their own \"Godfather knockoff\" in the ensuing years. Marlon Brando - who, despite the sound of his last name, is not Italian - must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting \"Italian\" accent.I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.\n",

I don't think you could beat a movie like this, but as well as the other fantastic movies, the godfather is one of the classics i think of all time. This is top of the imdb list as it's the number 1 top 250 movie at the moment, it has been for a long time and i would think it would take some beating to knock this movie off the 250 top movies list. I think that there won't be a better movie that would top the 250 best movies ever, because the godfather is an amazing movie and it is fantastic. I give this movie 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 460: The GodfatherThis is one of the greatest movies ever made. Second only to Goodfellas and tied with The Godfather Part II this is the 2nd greatest movie ever made. The movie is nearly perfect.Plot: The plot is amazing. Based on the fantastic book by Mario Puzo this cuts the book down into 3 hours. Although I like the book better, it doesn't make the movie any less.Acting: While the plot is great, the acting is probably the strongest point in the entire movie. While I Goodfellas is just barely superior, the acting in The Godfather is superior to Goodfellas. Marlon Brando gives a very convincing performance as Don Vito Corleone(aka The Godfather) and won the Academy Award. James Caan also gives a great performance as Santino 'Sonny' Corleone which got him an Academy Award nomination. Robert Duvall: Academy Award Nomination. The biggest surprise however when this movie was released was Al Pacino. He's my favorite actor alongside De Niro and he shot to stardom overnight with his performance as Michael Corleone, giving a sympathetic yet chilling performance. Also got a nomination and should have won.Genre/Quality: As a crime film it is a great movie. The only thing that made it less of a crime film than Goodfellas is that Goodfellas gave a more realistic and gritty look at the crime world. It isn't until Godfather Part 3 that it shows the complete dark side of the mob. This one in some ways seems to glorify it. The quality is great. Francis Ford Coppola decolorized it a bit giving it a more realistic tan look. Some of the greatest scenes ever were filmed in this movie. Finally the music is fantastic.If Goodfellas had not been made, this and The Godfather Part II would have been the two greatest films ever made.10/10\n",

It's no secret that the movie is better than the book, but it doesn't make it good.The story that turns violent ruthless criminals into men of honor and the horrible world of crime into something beautiful and almost royal.It's unnecessarily violent and why did Brando put paper towel in his mouth? I mean I like him as an actor, but this character is absolutely ridiculous.I don't understand how anyone could give an Oscar for that film! It's just stupid!\n",

            "Review 462: \"The Godfather\" is an American mostly English-language movie from 1972, so this one is already almost 50 years old now, 3 to go, and it runs for almost three hours. I am not even sure if it is necessary to talk about the basics here, but lets go. The director is Francis Ford Coppola and he is also part of the writing team. This is probably still the defining mafia movie and the rating here on imdb says it all. It won Best Picture at the Oscars and Marlon Brando (in heavy makeup) received the second Oscar of his career. Add to that a writing Oscar, but the movie was cut short because of the tremendous success of Cabaret at the Oscars this year where Fosse won Director over Coppola and Grey beat all the three supporting nominees from The Godfather. I don't think Pacino was in the right category though, but I guess they really were all over Brando and wanted to make sure that nobody (from his own film) could stop him from winning. Anyway, the film starts with Brando and he is certainly defining in the first 90 minutes of the movie until an assassination attempt happens and from that moment on he moves a bit into the background and the boys take over, most of all Pacino for whom it was really a star-making performance.Now as for the plot, it is a cleanly structured film really. There is basically one affair after the next and many of these issues don't have to do a lot with the next. The movie starts at the godfather's daughter's wedding and there is not really too much focus on the actual wedding process, but instead we are taken into the world of crime right away when an old acquaintance asks a lethal favor from Don Corleone. Pretty memorable beginning really that has been spoofed in many other movies, even animated ones not too long ago. Not much later, there is of course the really famous longer sequence that results in a bloody horse head between the sheets. And they get longer and longer as next up is the key plot that involves the Turk turning into the main antagonist as he plans to kill the godfather, takes out his most brutal assistant at the same time and abducts his lawyer. And while the latter is also considered a son (not by blood), we also witness how the godfather's offspring deals with this situation in their own very unique ways: Sonny the hothead, Fredo the weakling who cannot protect his father whatsoever, Tom Hagen (the reasonable one) and eventually Mike whose role is not too clear early and who is far far away from becoming the man he turns out to be at the end of the movie. There is still more focus for him on his love relationship to his significant other and he says he is not like his family. But the attack on his father and later on the killing of one of his brothers really change everything and we find out he is just exactly like his dad. As for Hagen, I still think Duvall is really good in this movie and there is one very brief moment in this film when we hear Vito Corleone say something like somebody who is not Italian like them, which shows that Hagen is really accepted as a son and also seen as Italian pretty much, even if he is German/Irish. This would be one of the really rare funny moments, slightly funny I guess, this film has to offer. It is never about making the audience laugh admittedly, but more to witness the demise of the old man and the rise of the new star eventually and the crime and brutal murders that come with it. As for Michael, this of course also includes him losing his wife when he is in Italy. Had that murder not occurred maybe he never would have returned and the story could have taken a completely different path.I think one of this film's biggest strengths is that despite the really big quantity of characters, even for a 3-hour movie, they are all fairly memorable with their quirks, mannerisms and backgrounds. Take McCluskey for example. The movie could have done completely without him and he is really only there to serve as support for the Turk, but still he is truly memorable. Actually, his little words on how he frisked hundreds of guys like Mike for guns is another somewhat funny moment. He has no idea what's coming his way. I also want to say a few words on Fredo. He is not as big as the others in here yet or actually he is not too far away either. His scenes are all memorable and he is really definition of weakness and incompetence in 1970s cinema. Of course, that is even more the case in the sequel where he plays an absolute key character. But in this one here, he is also vital really and you could write pages alone on his character and how he (re)acts. Truly sad really Cazale died so early, but he left us a truly remarkable character and honestly every film he made was a winner basically. Now another thing to add here is that it also the small moments that count. When Mike lies to Kay at the very end, we find out 100% where his priorities are now and that he won't let anything get in the way of keeping his father's empire intact.Another strength here is that Puzo and Coppola are not scared of killing off major characters and it works oh so well because it makes a whole lot of sense. Pay attention to the permanent contrast of new/young life vs. death towards the end: When Vito dies, there is nobody around him except his very young grandson and that still puts major focus on the family component that is oh so crucial here, also when Mike talks about somebody treating Fredo badly. Or the christening of course, which is the best example with the baby and the alleged goodness vs. all the killings that take place at the same time. Vito was gone and that point already and he had gotten soft anyway, but Mike is not scared one bit about blood on his hands to defend his family's honor. Overall, this is a tremendous movie and when we see the bodyguard guy close the door eventually between Mike and Kay, it is all clear. Mike has turned into his dad by then. And how things go on, you can watch in the second film that in my opinion (thanks to Bobby) is even better than the first, even if the majority does not disagree.But yeah as for this one here, it was the third time I watched it I think and it gets better with each viewing I suppose. It is a film you don't wanna miss out on. Highly recommended, really close call between Cabaret and this one for me when it comes to 1972's finest. I'd still go with Cabaret though I think. It is just as much of a masterpiece. And finally, also pay attention to all the minor references included in here that seem even more interesting if you know how the saga continues. This is also why it is so much worth rewatching. One example would be Vito swearing on his grandchildren's well-being. There's many more. Do not miss out and girls who read this don't trust people saying this is a film that will only or mostly appeal to males. If you like quality filmmaking, then there is no way you should not watch! Oh yeah, but obviously you need to be able to stomach the violence. Just one example, there's a guy shot in the eye through his glasses and we see the blood pouring from his head and that is far from the most violent stuff depicted in here. That's all, folks. Watch it, don't be scared by the running time. You will not ask yourself afterwards if this was really worth 3 hours of your time, but if you are ready immediately for another 3 hours, namely the sequel. I was lucky enough to watch this film on the big screen and I am already looking forward to an occasion to see the second (and third). Certainly pick this opportunity over a small television or laptop screen. If necessary, wait for the 50th anniversary when it certainly will be shown again in many theaters. Mobster filmmaking at its finest.\n",

            "Review 464: The great example of how to execute a scene Synopsis Michael arrives to visit his father at the hospital and realizes that no one protects him and he knows that he is too vulnerable. It is a very difficult situation but Enzo arrives and says that he can count on his help and Michael tells him that he is waiting outside the hospital (at the door) Enzo obeys He throws the flowers away, puts his hands in his pockets and lifts her collar. (remember that Enzo and Michael are not used to dealing with this type of problem, they are not murderers, they are just 2 people outside a hospital)After that action, a car is seen arriving, but seeing precisely 2 guys standing outside, they prefer not to take risks and do not go in to attack. They realize? With just an action as simple as being outside a hospital, they stopped the possible murder of Vito Corleone And it is not unlikely at all, on the contrary, it is very logical that they would not want to enter just by seeing them there since they deduced that there would be more than them. It is impressive how they manage to narrate this whole situation and solve it in a simple but logical way If you think about it, this whole scene contains the 4 levels of conflict And it is essential since Michael for the first time acts as a corleone With this you realize that no, it's godfather it's not like any movie it's ART. The entire film is narrated by someone who knew exactly what to tell and how to do it, and this can be easily seen by how a simple action of standing outside a door has everything to do with it. A plot weight behind. This doesn't need great special effects or illogical stuff, this had a great writer, director and acting. Without a doubt, no one can deny that The Godfather is a masterpiece.\n",

            "Review 466: Just like Muhammad Yusuf (Dilip Kumar) the Icon of Indian Cinema is the Pinacle of Acting in the East, 'The Godfather' is the Pinacle of Moviemaking in the West.1972 was the time, perhaps never to be revised again, when the great actors of the Black and White era transitioned onto color movies. Marlon Brando was one of them and this meant the past, present and future of Hollywood colliding together to create the masterpiece of masterpieces. Alfred Pacino, James Caan and the young director Francis Ford Coppola were the future, in association with the best of the past Marlon Brando. Thus, history was created and 'The Godfather' was made. I don't believe personally that there will be a time again in the future of American of British Cinema when there can be Talent such as this producing content such as this. The 'Good Times' of Film-making are surely behind us as Ideas such as these and Novels such as these have been written, sold and the ideas have been spent.Like all things Filmmaking may also die oneday, but the story of Mario Puzo's 'The Godfather', which came in the form of a Book from 'Fact to Fiction and then onto Live Screen into a movie, shall live on for ever and ever.Personally my second best movie of all time, very close to the Sequel 'The Godfather Part 2' which is my most favourite movie till-date.\n",

            "Review 469: Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks—\"they are animals anyway.\"This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes.\n",

            "Review 470: I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a \"rookie\" to the making of \"The Godfather\". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the \"Gold Coast\" of Long Island.

            "Review 481: Here it is, the big boss man Vito is sitting in his gold chair, petting his cat, showing power. The poor man is begging for money from Vito but Vito just taunts him. This is one of the first scenes and probably one of the greatest scene in the movie because it shows how dramatic the movie is by the Vito showing power and wealth by petting a cat and sitting in a gold chair.\n",
            "As I was watching this scene I thought I might give my opinion and review on the movie The Godfather. I think that The Godfather is a great movie for the time period it was made in. When it was made there wasn't a lot of technology they could use. But the movie is ultimately dramatic in a good way and it really expresses the characters feelings and emotions. Even though it is fictionalized The Godfather does add historic information to build off their plot which I love that the director did that. They also used one of the most amazing soundtracks I have heard in a movie. If that's not enough to convince you to watch it then I don't know what will.The movie is set in the 1950's where mafia superpowers are fighting for more power in New York. But this movie focuses on one specific family, the Corleone family. But when the leader of the family, Vito, gets in trouble with the other families he asks his son, Michael, to join the mafia and Michael reluctantly joins the mafia. But Michael starts getting involved in the violence in the mafia and he tries to maintain a normal relationship with his wife but ultimately keeps getting dragged deeper and deeper into the dirty, family business.One reason you should watch this movie is because even though it is old it got multiple awards for best actors and best pictures in 1973. To add on to that it got the BAFTA award for best film music. Now this is important because you can enjoy this movie, even though its old, and you can really experience the dramatic fashion of this movie because of the best actor awards and the best film music contributing to the greatness.Think about it, Vito's men are getting threatened and Vito is not having any of that. Then all of a sudden one of his men are killed and he says this line \"Revenge is best served cold\". Then out of nowhere two of Vito's men drowns another man that was apart of the gang threatening Vito and his gang. I love this line because it shows how dramatic the movie can be and how it expressive Vito is to go through with the murder.The movie is really good and I suggest that you give it a watch. It is definitely worth your time and is a 70's classic. And all the achievements and lines from this movie is amazing and will executed. Also this movie also influenced me to really go and try out different things outside my comfort zone. I really hope this review convinced you to give it a watch and this movie shows that joining gangs only leads to violence so don't join a gang.\n",

            "Review 482: I also saw Godthumb first. Both are eminently more watchable and enjoyable. I actually do understand the characters and feel for them in both of those movies. But The Godfather...I just don't get why so many people say this is a great movie. Perhaps it's to be cool and one of the crowd? I was bored.Yes, there are some powerful scenes. Yes the brutality was startling back then and it still works today and fits the story, as opposed to the gratuitous and badly done violence in many movies. Yes, it was also interesting to see some amazing actors at their start. The story is even interesting so that I might be moved to read the book. However, I found the pacing too slow and the dialogue and interpersonal relationships trite and shallow. I'm glad I finally saw this and found out it doesn't really glorify the mafia because I was not moved by anyone or empathetic with their choices. I'm glad I finally saw it so I could say I did. But I won't be watching it again. I hear #2 is the best...it has to be.\n",

            "Review 483: Until a viewing last month, I hadn't watched The Godfather (Francis Ford Coppola, 1972) for a good five years. In the interim it seems to have got even better - if such a thing is possible.Marlon Brando is Vito Corleone, the mafia don whose empire starts to crumble when he opts out of a move into narcotics, only for war-hero son Michael (Al Pacino) to enter the fold, jettisoning his father's dream that he'd become a senator. It's grand and sweeping, and yet intensely personal: a wonderfully-acted fusion of family saga and human tragedy whose key players inhabit a vivid world of fierce ethics and bloody violence. Coppola and co-scripter Mario Puzo (who wrote the source novel) have plenty to say about family, honour and the American Dream - and the classic scenes are just legion.Some have argued that Brando's Oscar-winning performance is really a supporting role, but despite a lack of screen time he dominates the entire film and provides many of its finest moments. There's the moment he learns of Sonny's death, then calls in an emotional favour (\"Look how they massacred my boy\"), and a simply staggering two-handed sequence in which he maps out past and future to his successor. \"I thought that... when it was your time that - that you would be the one to hold the strings,\" he says. \"This wasn't enough time, Michael, it wasn't enough time...\"The old-fashioned storytelling, complete with impeccable production design, is augmented by Coppola's use of '70s innovations, like overlapping dialogue and informal out-of-focus close-ups, as well as Nino Rota's unforgettable score. The staggering ensemble includes not only Brando and Pacino (who is simply brilliant), but also James Caan as the last word in likable hotheads, Robert Duvall playing pragmatic family lawyer Tom Hagen and veteran Richard Conte, superb in his key supporting role as Don Barzini. It's a magnificent movie.\n",

            "Review 488: I have dissected this film, piece by piece. This is a film that can be seen several times, and each time, you take something else from the film. It's incredibly difficult to digest all of the beautiful layers that make The Godfather so special. There are thousands of films out there that are cut-n-dry. Basically, what u see is what u get....no less, no more. While, if u don't have an understanding of organized crime and its origin, u will most likely overlook the remarkable accuracy of the film. The life that is portrayed in The Godfather was very real, for many many years. However, as yrs went by, organized crime families, in America, began slowly straying from their core values...i.e., family, \"Omerta\" (code of silence), secrecy, respect, loyalty, etc. The Godfather illustrates life in the mafia during the 1st half of the 20th Century, where as a film like Goodfellas, shows mafia life during the 2nd half of the 20th Century. The Godfather is a film loaded w legendary actors who perform a script that's full of substance & grace, both, written & directed, by the great Francis Ford Coppola. Movies like, The Godfather, come around only a handful of times during a lifetime. Cinematic masterpiece.\n",
            "\n",
            "Review 489: A few thoughts and observations on an American classic- I doubt 'The Godfather' was shot sequentially (hardly any movies are) but it sure seems to me that the first scene, the wedding scene, was also the first one filmed. The reason I say this is that none of the actors seem completely comfortable with their characters yet; it's as though they're still figuring them out, unlike later in the film, where almost all the actors absolutely inhabit their roles. The same goes for the direction and dialogue, which contains some heavy-handed exposition that is noticeably missing later on too. (Robert Duvall's Tom Hagen tells his wife at one point that he has to go back to work because no Sicilian can refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day. Oh really? His wife never knew this? She's finding out just now, in the middle of the festivities?) As Sonny, James Caan is still working on his swagger, and even Marlon Brando is shown at his desk, holding a cat and stroking it, as though he's auditioning to be the next James Bond villain. (There are no further shots of him holding a cat.) This early awkwardness soon passes but the next scene is just as confounding, in a different way. Hagen is sent to California to convince a Hollywood producer to give a movie role to Johnny Fontaine, Don Corleone's godson. This scene sticks out like a sore thumb now and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, despite providing 'The Godfather' with one of its most famous images, that of the severed horse-head in the movie producer's bed. No, it's only when Hagen returns to New York that the film really begins. The first several times I saw 'The Godfather,' I had a difficult time breaking it down into segments and sections, as in what happened in relation to other things going on in the film. This of course is the sign of smart scripting and directorial slight-of-hand, and clever pacing which keeps you guessing. For instance, the different scenes where Luca Brazi is killed, then Don Corleone is shot, Tom Hagen is briefly kidnapped by Sallozzo, and Michael Corleone finds out what has happened. These all seem to happen at roughly the same time, but Michael finds out from a newspaper! Yet one never questions it while watching. There are so many great and famous scenes, it's hard to pick favorites, but I notice now when I watch it, I particularly enjoy the one where Don Corleone and his inner circle meet with Sallozzo, just before the aforementioned violence. It's one of the few times in the lengthy film where we actually get to see the Don at work guiding his empire and making decisions. Not a great deal happens in the scene, but it's a good example of Don Corleone's thinking and helps explain why he is held in such high regard, why he is in fact the 'irreplaceable man', as will soon become apparent. Sonny is obviously to be his successor, and just as obviously lacks the old man's reasoning and negotiating skills. Fredo is just another body in the room and Michael isn't yet \"with\" them. Despite the incredible wealth and influence we've seen the Corleone family possess, this scene and its immediate aftermath show just how fragile and tenuous its grip on power is in dangerous circumstances. The relative ease with which the Don is set up and shot, as well as the quick dispensing of his main hit-man, Luca Brazi (who had been portrayed as almost invincible), proves that Sallozzo was correct, in the short term anyway: get rid of the Don and his empire collapses into confusion. The rest of the film is more or less the laying out of a careful and methodical revenge plotted by both Michael and the old Don, following a major subplot having to do with Michael hiding out in Sicily after killing Sallozzo and a New York police captain. It all leads to perhaps the most famous scene of all in 'The Godfather,' the baptism sequence where everyone who plotted against the Corleones get their comeuppance, from Connie's husband Carlo to the rival Mafia chieftains who hoped to exploit the Corleone family's momentary weakness. That it feels like justice being served says something about how Coppola has successfully manipulated the audience into rooting for the Corleones. The word 'adventure' doesn't usually come to mind when discussing 'The Godfather,' but that's what it is, an astonishing adventure for the characters and an eye-opening look inside a powerful crime family for the audience.\n",

            "Review 490: What more could be said about the Godfather (1+2). The legacy of mafia crime family dramas begins and ends here. The lines of dialogue have been forever embedded into the American culture and film discourse. Pacino, Brando, Dinero, Keaton, Caan, and the whole cast fit the bill with impeccable conviction.The morals and themes of the pictures have such a profound impact unlike any preceding film. It empathizes with a traditionally antagonistic side of society and shows its varying dimensions. Men who steal, rob, and murder do so for reasons other than their own personal self-indulgence. They believe 'the life' is for the greatest benefit for their family, but then take it too far. Films up to this point had a narrow view of the motivation of the accomplices in organized crime. The Godfathers enlightened the film going public about the motivations of the mafia, crime and crime families but doesn't defend it. It merely observes the chosen and or inherit ethics of life in the crime family.\n",

            "Review 491: I suppose it's difficult to qualify exactly what formulates a tragedy.  Are tragedies about fate, disillusionment or death?  Are they about language? Must the plot adhere to a strict set of rules?  Must the climax come in the third act?  Well, my concept of a tragedy is when the flaws of one or more of its characters destroy a high goal.  In the case of the Godfather, this goal is the prevention of Michael's entry into the family business by making him a true American; the tragic flaw is Michael's inability to forego vengeance.Certainly many efforts are made to prevent Michael's tragic fate.  Michael himself seeks to evade becoming like his family.  When telling Kay about how his father released Johnny Fontaine from a band contract by making the band leader `an offer he couldn't refuse,' Michael says, `That's my family Kay, not me.'  While the rest of his family wears tuxedos at the wedding, Michael wears his dress uniform.  While his family talks about the drug business with Solozzo, Michael and Kay go shopping and go to the movies. \n",
            "By the time Michael saves his father in the hospital, it is already clear that Michael has no desire to be involved in the family business, but the attempt on his father's life is the first revelation of Michael's tragic flaw.  In the scene where Michael agrees to kill Solozzo and McClusky, Hagen tells Sonny that he is taking business matters personally.  When Michael agrees to kill them both, Sonny accuses him of the same.  Of course, a central irony of the Godfather is the fact that the family is the business, ties of blood and ties of money become inseparable.  Sonny's accusations are correct, Michael is taking the matter personally, the only major difference between Michael and Sonny is Michael's calculating patience.  This difference is painfully obvious by the end of the film.  Sonny dies because he carelessly charged after Carlo when he discovered that Connie was beaten after his initial death threat.  Michael waits for the perfect opportunity to have Carlo murdered, never allowing Carlo to suspect his motives.  After his betrayal, Tessio asks Tom Hagen to `tell Michael it was strictly business.'  Hagen replies that Michael knows.  Despite the fact that murdering Tessio and losing his knowledge of the Bronx is bad business, Michael has him killed.  This is further evidence that Michael is not acting out of his business interests, but his inability to forego vengeance.Kay is a very important figure in this tragedy, I say `figure' because to Michael, Kay as a person is irrelevant.  Kay's value to Michael is her lack of connection to his family.  She is from New Hampshire, so he most likely met her at Dartmouth (he went to college while his other brothers learned the family business). At the beginning of the film, Michael has Kay appear in his family photo.  He tells her everything about his family and while his family is planning, he is spending time with her notably shopping at the store `Best & Co.' and watching a movie about a nun.  These details are significant because Michael views Kay as a better sort of person than his family; he sees her as a figure of salvation.  When he returns from Italy and has entered the family business, Michael tells Kay that he has to marry her.  `The old way is finished.  Even my father knows that now.  In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.'  Michael sees Kay as a figure through which he will achieve that legitimacy.  When Kay asks Michael if he had Carlo killed Michael's reaction is the exact opposite of what he would have told her at the beginning of the film.  Instead of telling Kay everything and defying the old rule of never letting women know about the family business, Michael told her all of his family's stories willingly and with complete honesty.  In this scene, Michael reveals not only that he won't let Kay know about his affairs, but lies he finally agrees.  The final shot of the movie, the closing of the door as a wiping fade out is significant because it shows Kay's separation from Michael.  She has literally and figuratively been removed from him, salvation rejected.Easily the most telling scene on this film's tragedy is the scene in which Vito tells Michael that he `didn't want this' for him.  He tells Michael that he wanted him to be a Senator or a Governor.  This is interesting when compared to Michael's rationalization of his work to Kay in which he suggests that all men of power are the same.  Vito dies in the very next scene of natural causes, but with the knowledge that the son for whom he had such great hope had been damned. The scene immediately following the death of Vito is the baptism of Michael's nephew, which is brilliantly cross-cut with the murders of the heads of the five families and Mo Green is a sequence in which holy water is crosscut with blood, renunciation of Satan is juxtaposed with acts of murder and the sacred is connected to the vile.  Vito's way of doing things is finished.  Vito openly told the heads of the families that `I forego the vengeance on my son' and `I will not be the man to break the peace of this day.'  It is Michael who breaks the peace.  Vito was a reluctant Godfather who spend his life running `harmless vices' and declaring that `we're not murderers' when refusing to hit the men who assaulted Bonassera's daughter, ultimately has a cold, calculating man who rationalizes murder as his successor, defying all his hopes for the future.\n",

            "Review 492: I saw this movie years ago, and I loved it. It was my favourite movie. This morning, I watched it again, and began to pick it apart.This movie is first and foremost overlong. Unnecessary dialogue and scenes weaken the raw effect that could have been produced. The musical sequence after Pacino does his restauant thing is unlike any other in the movie, it doesn't fit in. The part of the movie detailing Pacino's stay in Italy is poorly done, and also doesn't fit in.Some of the performances are dull, such as Keaton's, Lettieri, and Conti. Yes, I do believe Brando's part is badly written. I know I will be hated for saying this, but the character constantly changes, and his dialogue is never consistent. Brando does his best, and I don't think anyone could have done better, but it was still not a great part. The only outstanding performances were those of Caan and Pacino. Caan's acting is raw and Pacino is right on target.Besides the main theme, music is weak and unfitting. As I have said, some of the scenes don't fit, and the music score doesn't help any. At one moment, the movie is a gritty masterpiece, and  at another a cheesy, cliched piece of film, going back to the traditional style of film, ruining the film's effect. Had the movie cut all the silly dialogue, not to mention the sans-dialogue scenes that aren't even poetic, which a dialogueless scene should be, the effect might  be better.Also, to throw some more mud, the romance between Keaton and Pacino is awful, and no chemistry is arisen.A disappointment, but not to be missed. I recommend a single viewing.

This probably won't be very popular - but this movie is way way too slow. There is a lot of talking and very little action, which would be OK if the dialogue was special - it isn't.What saves The Godfather for me is the performances. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino in particular - you can tell they are at the peak of their powers and giving the performance everything. Their characters are complex and interesting. Brando as Don Vito Corleone is a criminal but with a good heart. Al Pacino wants to avoid crime but he has a streak of evil in him. The development of the characters and handover of the criminal empire keeps the otherwise dull storyline ticking over.I've given this movie a 7/10 on the strength of the performance, but I won't be watching it again.\n",

In his early 20's, he stepped into the society, had contact with the world at the beginning, just opened the chapter of his life, and watching Godfather certainly felt obscure and gloomy. At this age, it's normal that we can't look down: we haven't understood the responsibilities and responsibilities of career, family, friendship and love, and we can't even know the cost of men's growth.When you are a little older, no one will help you or forgive you unconditionally.

            "If you have not seen the Godfather, do yourself a favour - skip my comments, and rent it today! I have seen this movie too many times to comment without giving away key elements.This movie is a cinematic landmark - one of the great achievements of the 20th century. From its quiet opening in Vito Corleone's office, with the the blubbering appeal of Amerigo Bonasera (\"Make them suffer as I have suffered\") to the closing of that same office door at the end, when Kaye comes to grips with the man she married, every frame of this film is filled with intrigue, images and treachery.You cannot view this film and judge its morality - it has none. It told entirely on its own terms. All the main characters are career criminals and the only law enforcement office in the movie is a corrupt cop protecting a drug dealer. To watch the movie, you have to accept its terms. If you do, you will be in for an experience of a lifetime.The wedding scene at the beginning is brilliant. Slowly but surely, all the characters are introduced, while at the same time, we get bits of information on their personalities and foreshadowing of future events. Note some of the payoffs that this scene sets up. That Paulie Gatto is a traitor (\"If this was someone else's wedding). That Bonasera the undertaker will owe the Don a service, to hide his son's massacre from his wife. That the plea of Johnny Fontaine for a movie role will result in him reluctantly agreeing to perform at a casino for the family. And of course, there is the introduction of the fearsome Luca Brasi.Marlon Brando makes this movie great. Don Corleone is arguably the most famous and most imitated character in movie history. The accent, the hand gestures, the sly smile he give Solozzo are  all a credit to an acting genius.The score by Fellini composer Nino Rota is one of the creepiest and most famous in film history. It complements the film rather than overpowers it, and gives the Godfather its unique quality. Gordon Willis' cinematography can only be described as perfect.The movie ends with the famous \"baptism scene\" in which Michael renounces Satan while executing all of his enemies - the baptism is the perfect alibi. In this scene, we learn how Michael views himself - a man in perfect control over his own world, above the law of both man and God. Truly fascinating.The Godfather also contains my single favourite line in movie history, spoken by Clemenza after the murder of Paulie Gatto: \"Leave the gun. Take the canoli.\"I like Part II even more, because the plot is more involving and the flashback scenes to the rise of Vito Corleone are the best cinematic work ever (imho). Needless to say, these movies are numbers 1 & 2 on my all-time list.For me, this is a perfect motion picture. **** out of ****.\n",

Al Pacino secured his place in history thanks to this movie, a Perfect 10, whoever said this movie was bad, I don't see how anyone could respect their opinions about anything.\n",

I do not agree with everyone that says this is the greatest movie of all time (people also say citizen kane, or Shawshank is the greatest movie of all time), I just didn't enjoy the movie. The biggest problem with the movie is the pacing, which is overly slow. I still love this movie! I think it's funny that marlan brando put cotton balls in his cheeks for this role.

            "Review 510: Call me crazy, call me whatever, but I simply didn't get the movie. I think I know the reason why. After seeing 1000s of rip-offs and the motives inside this movie explored to the death in countless movies since the 70s, the initial hand-kissing scene looks pretty trite. Or the making an offer you can't refuse? Puhleeze! The movie is quite slow. I know it is all about the atmosphere, but it really is nothing special. Neither does the mumbling of Marlon Brando convey any special significance to me. Yes, he is remorseful for being a powerful leader of a criminal empire and assigning this fate to his son. Boo hoo hoo. If you don't become a crook you don't have these kinds of problems. And yes, we all get it. The aggressive son is doomed to be killed in retaliation, the ineffectual son is doomed to remain in the shadows and the resourceful son is destined to take over the \"family business\". He simply kills off his adversaries without it ever being made clear how he outsmarted them or why no one ever came for him in a similar fashion. He actually turns into quite a ruthless son-of-a-... But there is something more fundamental about why the movie isn't \"doing anything\" for me. The entire notion of \"honor\" and \"chivalry\" among criminals. It's completely fake. Now that America is mostly out of the grip of such people (not so in my own country I'm afraid, but still far from Chicago of the 20s) glorifying them is easy. The truth however is quite different. Criminals usually talk of honor, but their actions are based on much baser things. And they always have an excuse for why they ended up being crooks. Don't get suckered into believing movies like these convey any truth. Rating 5/10Scale: 10 MASTERPIECE, 9 Excellent, 8 Good, 7 OK, 6 Adequate, 5 Average, 4 Mediocre, 3 Poor, 2 Bad, 1 HORRIBLE\n",

This is the template for how movies should be made. You love/hate the people. You feel their lives. You believe and cast aside doubt. You get wrapped up in the thing. This is what a movie is supposed to do.It's more than a mafia movie, it's a movie about family and loyalty, about love and determination. There is no comic relief, except Luca testing his devotion to the Don, and then tragedy. Yes, a very tragic movie but very well done. There are triumphs. There are falls. All very well mixed and very well done. Excellent work done on the costume and general set work. It draws you into the time and place, as a good movie should. No cheap shots, no pandering.

And my oh my was I impressed. I was so digressed into the film it felt like I was part of the family.And Marlon Brando. Marlon Brando. One of the best and most compelling performances I have seen in a while. He is just so... perfect. He is a gangster. The guy murders people. And yet he is the most likeable person in the whole film. I wish he was my godfather. I mean its no wonder he got an oscar!Al Pacino gives an equally fine performance as he perfectly shows his path from a heroic war hero to a ruthless crime boss. Every scene with him is just so exciting and inticing to watch especially in the restaurant scene. The tension being built from the beginning to the end gave me goosebumps.I'm am glad the main array of cast members got there deserved nominations.Watching this film 51 years after it was first released doesn't make a difference. Sound brilliant. Picture quality astounding. Not to mention the blood effects were incredibly realistic that they made me jump.Credits to the director who made this film like watching a documentary. Everything about it just feels so real.I am more than excited to watch the second one although I'm a bit sad Marlon Brando won't be there.Overall. One of the greatest films of all time and definitely a 10/10.Leon Soteriou.\n",

            "Review 513: How do you define a movie's greatness? For me, it's pretty straightforward; mainly the direction, the script, and the acting. And the Godfather triumphs on every level. Coppola and Puzo have created an epic tale of a powerful mafioso patriarch passing his crown down to his unwilling son, and the shift of power unfolds brilliantly with betrayal, vengeance and tragedy.Marlon Brando delivers one of the most intensive performances ever seen in film seemingly effortlessly. His calm demeanor carries along a subtly powerful and intimidating presence. Al Pacino is a revelation in his first role in a major film, displaying his range as he moves from the role of a heroin addict in The Panic in Needle Park, to the reluctant successor of the Don who transforms from the righteous war hero into a ruthless king. James Caan is PERFECT for the hot-headed Sonny, as is Robert Duvall as the intelligent Tom Hagen and John Cazale as the tragic figure of Fredo.I will run out of superlatives if I continue. Overall, The Godfather is a timeless classic that will always be the epitome of how a truly magnificent epic film should be.\n",

            "Review 514: Everything about The Godfather is brilliantly framed--well, almost. The depiction of Sicilian country life is, perhaps, a bit crass. Even so, its insular depiction of the world of Cosa Nostra was true enough to life to win the laud even of members of the criminal organisation.In the first place, \"The Godfather\" does an excellent job of weaving together the literal and metaphorical world of the mafia. Within the mafia, traditional institutions are given a warped, double meaning in which to frame illicit activity. For example, \"mafioso\" literally means, \"man of honour,\" but \"honour\" refers to a loyalty to an entirely different set of rules than those to which any Christian (or post-Christian) would consider even remotely acceptable. \"Famiglia,\" as used in Cosa Nostra, means a criminal corporation. \"Cristiano\" in the Sicilian tongue often designates not merely a Christian but any human being; to CN it signifies any ordinary man of honor. As for \"godfather,\" one mafioso standing godfather to another's son is often a formalisation of an illegal business pact.Puzo's and Coppola's Corleonesci, however, carry the double-edged sword of actually showing both meanings of these loaded words. The mafia family here IS a literal family; the men of honor, portrayed as they are in a closed word, CAN actually be viewed sympathetically as \"honourable.\" (Of course in real life most mafiosi are literally Catholics {albeit sham Catholics}.) Here, the closed world so carefully guarded through layers of command in real life is given further immunity and legitimacy by actually being what it publicly claims to be--and so much more.Little needs to be said about the performances, which are by and large stellar; the casting of Al Pacino is of course a near sure sign that the film will succeed. Perhaps Diane Keaton may not be much to look at, but she does not play a major role in this installment. Neither do the cinematography, the score, the high-level tension, etc. ad infinitum, require further laud than has already been heaped upon this film. If you haven't seen it yet, you've probably been living under a rock. Immaculate taste and Latin sophistication await, all ye primitives...\n",

Without leaders like Coppola or Puzo, the book to film could have been a disaster. The story is well-told in length and detail. Characters are built up and explained well. After Godfather, it must be hard for Coppola to make any follow up movie. This movie has stood almost 30 years and it is still one of the most entertaining addictive movies to watch. You just can't leave it yet until its done. People know the Godfather backwards and forwards. I love the scenes shot in Italy with Pacino and the cast. While they use subtitles to relay the Italian language, the movie leaves you breathless. Pacino, DeNiro, Duvall, Caan, Shire, Keaton, were unknown until this movie was released. We all remember Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski. His performance in this film is equally brilliant and incredible. You can't help but watching this film over and over again.\n",

            "Review 517: \"The Godfather\" is one of those films that everybody knows about. I heard about it for the first time when I was about three years old, and finally saw it at about age thirteen, after my parents gave in. what I mean to say is that it has achieved such universal fame that it's quoted and discussed everywhere, and rightfully so.\"The Godfather\" has it all. The cast is classic and the acting universally stellar, the shooting scenes have just the right level of intensity, the lines are all delivered with precision, the plot is enthralling, and the characters are actually interesting to watch.What is the secret to the success of this great film? That's a tough question, but it's really the fact that everything about the film is done to just the right level. It's never boring, and the plot holds plot twists, but not so many that you grow suspicious of the film.As I've said, the acting is exceptional. Obviously, Marlon Brando gives a legendary performance as the likable Don Vito Corleone. However, also noteworthy is James Caan's fiery performance as Sonny Corleone, and Robert Duvall' star-making work as the cool and collective Tom Hagen. The only shame about this movie is that Al Pacino didn't win an Oscar for it. His portrayal of the reluctant future godfather of the family who is eventually completely corrupted by power is pitch-perfect. The fact that Joel Grey won it instead for his clown-faced role in Cabaret is laughable and painful.The bottom line is this. \"The Godfather\" will always go down in history as the greatest film of all time, and for good reason. It's \"an offer you can't refuse.\"\n",

            "Review 520: The question everyone will likely ask me upon viewing the lengthy and heavily-celebrated Godfather I will not answer. That question is \"is it really the greatest film of all time?\" I can't answer it. I'm in no position to, nor have I seen every film ever made to correctly state that. How can you say what the greatest film of all time is if you haven't seen literally every film ever made? That question will never be answered. If you polled a million people, the question would still be answered with subjectivity. There is no possible way to define what is the greatest film of all time without any subjective input. It can't be done.I will say The Godfather is an important film. Perhaps the greatest, but definitely one of the most important in the history of the art form. Its depiction of the mob, to my knowledge, is dead on, and runs like a stage play or opera at opus length. It is three hours long, and I recommend two or even three sittings before you finish it. To take it in all in one sitting is difficult, not just because of length, but because of content. It is five minutes shy of three hours and feels every bit as long. It's not a problem, since the film immerses you with intricate visuals, dialog, and its casual glide of events, but it makes for a sometimes testing excursion.Everyone knows the story, so I won't go into it. Basically, we follow the Corleone family, an Italian mob run by Don Vito, played with unmatchable talent by Marlon Brando, after his daughter Connie (Shire) is married to Carlo Rizzi (Russo). After that, we see dramatic events following the wedding and run-ins with other gang outlets, fights, and lengthy monologues involving the family.I grew up on Scorsese's mob flicks, and one who has will find a grand difference between Scorsese's portrayal of mob life and Francis Ford Coppola's portrayal. For one, Scorsese's mob films, of course we're primarily speaking of Goodfellas, were more about exploiting the lifestyle, with an outsider looking into the action, who would eventually become one of them. In contrast, Coppola brings us right into the lifestyle, not from an outsider's perspective, but from the perspective of many different family members. Don Corleone is not the main character in the film. Nor is Carlo Rizzi. Surprisingly, Al Pacino's Michael is the one who lifts most of the picture off the ground in terms of characters.Pacino is outstanding. Every scene he's in, he possesses an undeniable screen presence that is equal parts ominous and electrifying. Brando brings a unique sense of direction to the screen as well. He seems calmer, more confident than any mob boss I've seen portrayed before. It doesn't seem like he needs to hammer home the idea he is the boss. He believes without a shadow of a doubt everyone knows it, and if they don't, they soon will.The Godfather, like many classics, shows signs of age. It has a dated look to it, where all its colors appear to be washed out. It doesn't bother me, but I've heard others complain heavily. Some even find it to be \"overrated\" and boring. I don't really see it as that, mainly because I can see what makes the film top many \"best film\" lists. It has tremendous writing, intricate, serious directing from Coppola, gifted performances, and some of the most impressive cinematography, evoking seriousness, atmosphere, and detail to perhaps the sternest extent.But I can see people being underwhelmed because of one inevitable outlet; pop culture and media. The Godfather has to be one of the most parodied films of all time, with lines, events, and monologues tempered with and mocked in frequent TV shows, movies, and even children's shows. I did a short film in high school about \"The Doughnut Godfather,\" where a student dressed up in a fancy suit, put on a luxurious hat, and had a stuffed cat sit on his lap. This could very well make the film lose its serious aspect to some because immediately when we hear the line \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse,\" we divert our thoughts to where we've heard that before.Another big difference I noticed between Scorsese and Coppola's work is that Scorsese's mobster films are more about history, rather than characters. We do get heavy characterization, but each films seems to have a great deal of respect for mob history and real life events. Coppola focuses a lot more on characterization and performances, as well as creating vignettes involving the Corleone family, showing family meetings and murders. When we look back at Goodfellas, we do think performances, but we more or less think of events that shocked and surprised us. When we think Godfather, we immediately reminisce about the extremely involved and award-worthy performances.This could very well be one of the greatest films I've ever seen, but again, who am I to judge? My job is to say if I enjoyed a film and do I see audiences liking it. I'm sure many, if not every person, reading this review has seen The Godfather, and if not, then they have an extra task on their list. Unfortunately, some won't see the beauty because so many grittier mobster films have come out, that don't involve heavy monologues and intricate performances, and pop culture has greatly subtracted the impact the film once had. This shows gangsters in a different light. Ones that don't feel the need to boast power or success. They know you already know what they've done just by how they speak, act, and move.Starring: Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Richard S. Castellano, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Sterling Hayden, John Marley, Richard Conte, and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Francis Ford Coppola.\n",

While watching the film, at first sight, viewers wouldn't lose much time to learn that the gangsters portrayed in \"The Godfather\" don't care at all for human lives as business interests come before anything else. Hence, it is perfectly normal for a man to get his brother-in-law killed as he has been disloyal to his family. It is the violent scenes of this kind which aim to terrify without being gory. From a cultural point of view, the ubiquitous discourse about American values of Italian gangsters in America make Francis Ford Coppola's film an intellectually rich viewing experience wherein there is ample spotlight on participating in family gatherings, looking well after family members and choosing to converse in English instead of Italian. Apart from the character with a crooked face- actor Marlon Brando who garners all of viewers' sympathies, good performances have come from other leading players namely Robert Duvall, Al Pacino and James Caan. However, exquisite photography by veteran American cinematographer Gordon Willis and great Italian composer Nino Rota are two more reasons for watching this film about a ruthless family of criminals who left Italian shores to wreck havoc in a new land of dreams.\n",

            "Review 525: MOTION PICTURES having organized crime as the subject matter seem to be forever \"IN\" as fair game for a movie (\"Film' if it's a special, 'Top-Shelf'production). In every era we have seen filmed stories of Gangland. Some have been factual(ST.VALENTINE'S MASSACRE), some 'loosely' based on factual material (AL CAPONE-Monogram 1959, THE UNTOUCHABLES-all incarnations) and then there are those that are all fictional(THE DON IS DEAD,THE LAST DON,DONDI).FINALLY we have a category which is fiction, but not strict fiction; being an original work which, while not being the representation of historical events, it contains fictional events that are inspired by real life occurrences.THIS is the type of storyline that makes for the best fiction; also this type is the one that makes and needs those disclaimers that appear in the either the opening or closing credits of a Feature Film or TV series episode that say something like: \"THE EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS FILM/TV EPISODE ARE FICTICOUS. NO COMPARISON TO REAL PERSONS, LIVING OR DEAD ARE INTENDED NOR SHOULD BE INFERRED.\" TODAY'S honored/dissected film, MARIO PUZO'S THE GODFATHER(Alfan Productions/Paramount Pictures Corporation, 1972), is perhaps the best example of an exponent of this category of Gangster Film. While we all are aware that the story is not a true one; at the same time we also note that there are many characters and occurrences in the story, both in the book and on the screen, that were clearly either suggested by real people and actual incidents or were out and out caricatures of such.READILY we can identify fictional characters in the story that were doubtless obvious make-believe versions of denizens from our real world. The main character of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) seems to be a composite character; having taken certain characteristics from both Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino, New York Underworld Big-Wigs both as well as Dons of two different 'Families'. Carlo Gambino even had been known as 'the Godfather'.ANY casual gambler or vacationer recognizes that the character of Moe Green, a Las Vegas Casino Operator closely corresponds to the profile of real-life Ben \"Bugsy\" Siegel; who was both an early advocate and promoter of investing in and expanding the already existing gambling in 'Sin City'.(Ben Siegel was portrayed by Warren Beatty in BUGSY (Baltimore Pic./Mullholland Prod./Dessert Vision/Tri-Star, 1991, but that's another story!) QUITE POSSIBLY the most obvious connection between the factual actual and the all made-up fictional lies in that of the fictional singer. 'Johnny Fontaine' (real life singer Al Martino) has the most widely held opinion of naming 'old blue eyes'(himself), Frank Sinatra as being the leading suspect.THERE is indeed many similarities both in Mr. Martino's characterization, as well as the story's references to \"That Movie Big Shot\" and Johnny Fontaine's not getting the part in the War Picture that he wanted.* But in the novel, the singer Fontaine has a Comedian Partner! Can you say Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis? Allen & Rossi? how about Brown & Carney, Wheeler & Woolsey, Clark & McCullough, Abott & Costello, Laurel & Hardy, Samson & Delilah, St. Paul & Minneapolis....ON a personal note; the reported indignation expressed by some Italian-American Civic groups over NBC's premiere network broadcast of the film seemed to be less serious than originally reported; as practically every Italian we ran into that day said something like, \"Hey! The Godfather's on tonight!\" AND in summary, we admit it, we love those Gangster Pictures. Most folks do. But our only real criticism of the Film and the Puzo Novel is that they both tend to raise the status of Don Corleone to that of being something that a real Gangland Boss would not ever be. By way of a comparison, let us just say that Vito's conscientious and benevolent characterization is an extreme and a sophomoric falsehood. It rings no truer than the persona given to mythical Nevada Senator Geary(G.D.Spradlin) as a completely evil, patently dishonest & ruthless louse in THE GODFATHER, PART II, (1974).NOTE * The references are thought by many to be of Frank Sinatra's getting the part in FROM HERE TO ETERNITY over Columbia Pictures Mogul Harry Cohn's preference for Eli Wallach. Maybe, but again, maybe not.AND remember, Schultz, the answer is no about the singer character. He was Johnny Fontaine, not Frank Fontaine (Crazy Googenheim in the Joe the Bartender segment of THE JACKIE GLEASON SHOW (CBS, 1960's)!)\n",

The excessive amount of time (eg. The first 30 mins at the wedding) does not do well to set the pace of the film - instead lulling the audience into a dozy stupor in which many viewers would be tempted to jump on their phone.The notable parts of this movie are the parts where action happens: the tense encounter with the police chief, the scene at the boom gates, the emotional garden scene with the don/grandson. These are the noteworthy parts of the film where the cast are finally given a chance to flex their talents.Unfortunately, I have to agree with many other low reviewer's summaries when I say this movie is overrated. While it may have been a great movie in the 1970's, or even 1980's, this movie is less likely to earn a 10 star review in 2021, and more likely to give you a three hour nap on the sofa.\n",

            "Review 528: First and foremost, the storytelling in The Godfather is unparalleled. The intricate plot weaves together themes of family, loyalty, power, and morality, drawing viewers into the dark and complex world of the Corleone family. The screenplay is brilliantly written, with each line of dialogue delivering depth and significance. The pacing is deliberate, allowing the story to unfold gradually, keeping you engaged from start to finish.The performances in this film are nothing short of extraordinary. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is legendary, showcasing his immense talent and commanding presence. Francis Ford Coppola's direction is masterful. The attention to detail, the use of lighting and cinematography, and the overall visual aesthetics create a dark and atmospheric ambiance that perfectly complements the narrative.Beyond its technical brilliance, The Godfather explores profound themes that resonate with audiences even today. It delves into the complexities of power, loyalty, and the consequences of one's choices. The film poses thought-provoking questions about morality and the blurred lines between good and evil, leaving viewers contemplating long after the credits roll.In conclusion, The Godfather is a true gem of cinema. Its compelling story, exceptional performances, and impeccable direction make it an unforgettable experience that continues to captivate audiences over 50 years after its release. It deserves every bit of its reputation as one of the greatest films ever made. A perfect 10-star rating is the only fitting tribute to this timeless classic.\n",

            "Review 530: I can easily understand why this is considered by many people on EVERY single communication way as the best movie ever made. First of all, I have to say that this isn't a movie for everyone. If you are easily offended by violence then you should think twice before watching it as part of your film culture. I'm not saying it should be avoided because in my opinion; it's the most perfect film ever realized. \"The Godfather\" is perfect on every aspect. The plot is intriguing, very interesting but also very disturbing and cruel at some points. But the movie displays the reality of the horrors that surround mafia and narcotraffic. It also demonstrates the consequences of display of unlimited power, connections, and how leadership is vital for taking important decisions on any level.The Godfather's importance relies on it's influence on modern culture and cinema in general. I could go on and on mentioning the most memorable scenes and not make justice to them. (Taking a breath): The headless horse, Brasi's murder, Vito's demise, Michael assassinating the turk and the captain, \"leave the gun, take the cannolli\", \"Luca Brasi sleeps with the fishes\", the FINAL and almost heavenly baptism-massacre parallel situations. \"The Godfather\" is perfect. It paved the way for crime films and believe it or not, I'm sure it generated interest in mafias in the real world.The acting is superb, classic. Marlon Brandon delivers probably the most popular and outstanding performance in cinema. His portrayal as Don Vito Corleone generated a school of acting. Al Pacino plays his part with smoothness and demonstrates his cold blood in the most important family decisions. James Caan is also memorable as the wild, attracted to money son. He is the opposite side of Michael. Robert Duvall is fantastic, he is the most equilibrated character in terms of pace and emotions. Special mention to Lenny Montana for his display as the brutal cold blood bodyguard Luca Brasi and for Abe Vigoda. Also, Peter Clemenza was a key character that could only be acted by Richard Castellano. Diane Keaton was also excellent. The Direction is just amazing. Francis Ford Coppola created a sandbox where crime and politics were generated like a clockwork orange. The visuals are amazing; the Italian exteriors and the American settings make an excellent contrast on every single aspect. When I think of this movie; the first setting (the wedding) comes immediately to my mind. That is because it perfectly describes everything that's going on: negotiations, underground business, and mafia's working for their own benefit. But all these aspects just surround The Don, The Godfather. I'm amazed how all the events are important and relevant in order to deliver the final punchline. I can't praise this movie enough, what I've said, it's been said by millions of persons. But I declare myself as a die hard fan of The Godfather and I believe that \"his\" legacy will last forever.Having power has all kinds of consequences.\n",

            "Review 531: Filmed over 30 years ago, i believe that The Godfather to this day, is simply the best movie ever made. To be honest, i think that before they make another movie this good, particularly in this genre, we will be watching it with our children's children...if we're lucky.I had to watch The Godfather more than once to realise that this movie is actually more about family than the mafia or the underworld. Most of the vengeance and deaths in this movie are not caused by money or greed. They are for family. I must say i haven't seen a movie before that gives this much importance to family. Particularly Al Pacino's character - Michael does an unbelievable turn around when it comes to his family. It's just incredible. At first reluctant to get involved with the family business, Michael soon becomes more ambitious and tougher than everyone else, again only for his family.The fact that this movie is non cliché makes it more enjoyable to watch. It's not predictable in a sense where the good guy wins and bad guy loses eventually. It's so much more realistic than that. I have nothing bad to say about the length, editing and definitely about the cast. Al Pacino especially just continues to surprise me with how good he portrays his character. He is no doubt the best actor in Hollywood. Some people may find The Godfather very slow, dark and depressing. It's not the loudest and most 'vibrant' movie, but that's kind of the whole point. I believe those people should then stop watching movies from this genre, because if you did not like this one...you won't like any. No words and reviews can do this movie justice and i believe that unlike some over rated, inflated movies The Godfather actually deserves its big reputation of being a masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. without a doubt...10/10\n",

            "Review 534: A fine movie about the mafia in the day really have its advantages. They say that blood is thicker than water, that is no joke. Mario Puzo's \"The Godfather\" is a real masterpiece of fine art and work of generations of mobsters. Marlon Brando does a spectacular job playing Don Vito Corleone. This mob boss doesn't play around, even though he has a bull's eye painted on him. My mom has seen this movie before I came to the world, and I had to see it first on my own time, and she was right, it is good. The real kicker is when that mobster had one of his Clydedale's head in his bed, and freaks out indefinitely. That scene is a classic, makes a horror movie look corny. And that scene where \"The Turk\"(Al Lettieri) gets pumped in a restaurant, amazing! The ambushing, the seduction, and the loyalty turn to double-cross is all there in this movie. I know this is long, but it'll be worth your while. I adore great work despite all the violence. The cast is great, and if read the book, or any of his books, consider yourself loyal. Rating 5 stars!\n",

            "Review 535: Are you kidding me? This movie is at best a 6 on a good day. The mere fact that this movie continually shows up on AFI's Top Ten list tells me that action and brutality are preferred by Americans over plot and acting. It is a decent film but nothing more. There is no way it is in the same league as \"Gone with the Wind\", \"Casablanca\", or \"Lawrence of Arabia\". It angers me every time this movie gets voted # 2 on some movie list. Al Pacino and Brando are good, but it was not the best work that either of these actors produced. It is an entertaining film like \"Indiana Jones\" and \"National Treasure\" but it is not a classic. It is important to remember that just because a film is popular does not mean that it is a great movie. If you enjoy mob movies this one is probably the best of a bad lot in the modern era, but the older films with Bogart, Cagney, and Robinson put this film to shame. I will be delighted when people one day realize the true worth of this film.\n",

            "Review 536: The era of the gangster arrived with the foundation of a strong individual who wanted to make all organized gangs subservient to a single power. Although the idea was not totally unique as some historians have accredited it to 'Legs Diamond, 'Dutch Shultzs or it might have originated with Mr. Maranzano, Masseria, Luciano or even Al Capone. Whoever the originator, the consensus leans towards a traditional Italian family which emigrated from Italy and who revised the custom in America of the secret society of 'Omerta.' Influenced by such a society, Mario Puzo developed a dramatic story called \"The Godfather\" about a successful Patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) from Italy who founded an Olive Oil business and expanded it into other less legitimate areas including, strong arm protection, extortion, prostitution and gambling. Now with the family's fortune expanding and gaining political influence as well, the head of the family wishes to transfer his power to his eldest son, 'Santino' Corleone (James Caan) and retire. However, a new opportunity arrives in the form of an Italian mobster named, Virgil 'The Turk' Sollozzo( Al Lettieri) who wants to start importing illegal drugs. Advised by his step-son, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) that despite the danger, there is a fortune to be made in the trade. Refusing to get involved, the Don becomes a target for Emilio Barzini (Richard Conte) and other rival families and is plunged into a gang war, resulting in his own assassination and the attacks of many including his eldest son. That's when his youngest son Michael Corlone (Al Pacino) enters the family business and has a major task ahead. While this immense sage expands over the years and the American countryside, the family develops despite major setbacks, but as Michael promises, 'I'm gonna wait till I become a Godfather, then I will initiate my plan.' The movie has established itself as a monumental Classic and become immensely popular, spawning other similar films and catch-phrases such as \"I'm gonna make him an Offer, he can't refuse.\" A dramatic action film which reminds us, a movie can make heroes as well as scapegoats out of arriving immigrants. ****\n",

            "Review 537: After so many years of only knowing of this movie by reputation, I finally watched this in its entirety on a flight from Korean Air. It's such a violent movie and I was very surprised it was even shown on the plane though there was a disclaimer that anyone younger than 18 should only watch with an adult guardian. What did I think of the film, itself? Well, it's fascinating to watch all the scenes leading to certain killings and the male cast members certainly put their heart into the roles though the female cast members don't have as much of a chance to develop their characters as fully as their opposites. But knowing both Diane Keaton and Talia Shire have parts in the two sequels makes me think I'd get the know their characters better later on. I also read on Wikipedia of deleted scenes restored when the three films in the series were put together for TV and DVD/VHS so maybe that may also be an offer I couldn't refuse to watch someday. In summary, The Godfather was a very good film though I stop at considering it one of the greatest of all time...P.S. I was familiar with singer Al Martino way before his role in this film as my parents owned three of his record albums-This is Love, Spanish Eyes, and A Merry Christmas-that I used to listen quite frequently to as a kid during the '70s.\n",

The characters?  Isn't that what makes a good movie?  Or are the people who so verbosely extol the virtues of The Godfather all film/media students studying it for their coursework?

            "Review 540: I went into the Godfather expecting a masterpiece from all the reviews and how it number 2 or 3 on the IMDb top 250 films. After watching it I found it very disappointing for a few reasons. 1. You can't understand what the Godfather is saying half the time for the most part it all sounds like he's wheezing. If your going to watch this film put on subtitles.2. Its way to long. the movie is just shy of 3 hours long! Thats long enough and especially most of the time nothing is going on. I found myself not paying attention to most of the boring parts in the film and there's a lot. Now I know what your saying, your saying that i don't like long films. To you I say false i don't mind long films like the LOTR Return of the king is 4 hours + in the extended edition but there's a difference LOTR is entertaining there's action going on throughout 80% of the film. Now I'm not saying I hated the movie I'm justing saying it has a few flaws and its not perfect by any means. Now I have yet to see Part 2 maybe that will change my mind but right now it doesn't appeal to me because its 4 hours + long! All I can saying is that it better be more stuff going on in the movie then the first one.8.7/10 not a bad film but a few flaws\n",

My first impression of the movie was that it was plain boring. I have just watched \"The Godfather\" again ten years later. I am about to be twenty-seven years-old and I am a professor of English as a second language in two universities of my country so I can no longer think that my impression of the movie is biased by my young age or my lack of understanding of English -oh, I also speak Italian by the way.This movie is simply way too overrated.

            "Review 542: Being without doubt a quality movie (good plot, good acting, good directing) it is mysterious however why it is considered by many people to be the best ever made. The origin of this mystery needs some exploration. I think that technically the film is pretty well made although not without a flaw. I knew the great Nino Rota's melody long before I saw this movie and I was amazed how it was wasted in the film. Just an intermezzo??? And horribly performed...  I can suggest two reasons for the too high rating. 1. Americans adore their Mafia. And the film appeals to the desire of a simple man to imagine himself a deadly hero. That would explain also why it does not touch me too much. 2. The film was innovative in the time it appeared in manner I don't understand. Perhaps there were some cinematographic tricks that were revolutionary at the time and used in every other film since (that would explain why we do not see them). Godfather II impressed me much more because it goes against the first of the mentioned above reasons. No romanticism of the vengeance, no protection of the family any more. I think it was very courageous to show the bare face of Mafia in the country that adored it.  Deadly businessmen of the Godfather II are really horrifying. I cannot comment on suggestion number 2. But it any case that reason can have only historical significance.My rating for the film is 8 of 10.\n",

            "Review 543: There was a time in Hollywood, mostly during the 1960s, where the great motion picture factory lost its way a bit. We saw the rise of the pretentious independent production, and what studio output there was might be eye-catching but lacking in the old magic. Above all they had lost touch with the professionalism that characterised the industry back in its heyday. At last, in the early 70s, the younger generation of filmmakers began to grow up and Hollywood started to get its act together again. The Godfather is one of its great comeback pictures.Why has The Godfather become such a giant of cinema? Its story has no great emotional weight, no laugh-out-loud comedy, no rip-roaring action, no thrilling suspense. But it is, quite simply, a perfectly written drama. The screenplay adapted by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola from Puzo's novel is a great study of power because it takes a bunch of ruthless mob bosses going about their business, but shows their humanity through their reverence for the family, without ever once losing sight of their amoral coldness. It hooks us instantly with the power of that thought, so much so that it can afford to devote a major portion of its length (a full forty minutes of screen time, from the opening wedding to the notorious horse's head incident) merely introducing us to the way the Corleone world works, before even getting onto the real storyline. The fact that it can do this and still hold our interest shows the solidity of its ideas and characterisation.The Godfather also sees director Coppola at his very best. Coppola has a lot in common with an ace director of the previous generation, the consistently brilliant William Wyler, especially in his approach to actors. Like Wyler, Coppola fully understands that an acting performance is comprised of many facets – voice, facial expression, body language, distance from the audience – and a director can choose which to show and which not to show, to varying effect. Take that masterful opening shot – we are introduced to the eponymous Godfather in a slow zoom out, gradually revealing his bulky figure dominating the foreground, his back to the audience. This establishes the character as an intimidating presence – no face to be seen as yet. When we do see his face the dimness of the interior makes his stern expression all the more formidable for how hard it is to read. Even when we see him in brighter surroundings with the other wedding guests it is from an objectively distant crane shot. It is only later in the picture that he becomes human to us, and we get to see a little true emotion and softness in his face.Which of course brings us round to the sterling work of Marlon Brando. True to the gradual revelation of his character, he presents the Don as some kind of monster, with a face like a bulldog and a voice like an alcoholic with throat cancer. But, as over time we see the man showing tenderness for his offspring or torn up with grief, he manages to twist that ugly face into very real expressions. The effect is almost a little like the emoting of Boris Karloff as the Monster in Frankenstein. There is all-round good stuff from the rest of the cast as well. Al Pacino in particular has this brilliantly passive, steely air about him, and the dispassionate way he does everything is a sublime bit of understatement.When it came to the Oscars, The Godfather of course scooped Best Picture, but it lost most of the awards to one of the other amazing pictures of the early 70s, Cabaret, for which Bob Fosse won the Best Director prize. It seems odd to me, as I feel had the two pictures (or their equivalents) been around twenty years earlier Cabaret, which gives the greatest all-out entertainment, would have been Best Picture, while Coppola would have got Best Director for his intelligent helming of The Godfather. I guess a lot of this has to do with the auteur theory effect, and a general forgetting of just what it is a director does. Thus Fosse's colourful choreographing of cast and camera won over Coppola's subtle thoughtfulness in framing and staging. Still, regardless of what awards it did and didn't get, The Godfather was a real prize for the industry, proving at last that Hollywood was back on top.\n",

It's true, however, that my idea of what a masterpiece is could well be different to that of another film fan - at the end of the day, it's all about the relationship you have to what you see on screen, it's all subjective, isn't it? The latest CGI-laden blockbuster or socially relevant indie may be hailed as a genius piece of work, but surely it can only sit comfortably marked that way once some time has passed, once posterity has spoken, so we can see it if stands up. It might be considered a masterpiece now, but what about in ten years time when the world's changed a little bit?The Godfather is, for me, a genuine work of art and a film that gives something new each time you watch it. It stands up, a timeless story, almost fifty years on, as powerful and as epic as it's ever been. It's a film about family, about love, about revenge and power, themes used in most modern movies but never more effectively than here, all deftly strung together into a three hour saga that hooks you in from the very first words, \"I believe in America\", and transports you through time and continent to that final iconic shot of the door shutting on Kay Corleone's doubtful, fearful face.The first time I saw it, I remember so clearly being transfixed by the world Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo had created, by its characters, it's cinematography, by the haunting and operatic score, by the dialogue. The scene of no return for me, when I knew this film was really something I'd never forget, and watch countless times more, came right in the middle, that now infamous restaurant scene. Michael, the war hero who until now had shunned involvement in the family business, emerges from the bathroom and opens fire on the two men who have gravely injured his father. I remember my heart was in my mouth. I didn't want Michael to do it. I wanted him to keep hold of his goodness, to continue to shun that world, to be happy with Kay. But he did do it, and it devastated me, because his life was forever and irreparably changed. As a teenager who, up until that point, hadn't really ventured into what you'd call classic cinema, it became a milestone moment for me and ignited my love for what a film could truly be. It instantly became a favourite.It's an obvious answer to the question \"what's the greatest movie of all time?\", and again it's all subjective, but for me The Godfather reigns supreme and nothing really comes close. It's a film I'm always up for watching, and a story that never fails to break my heart. It is, there's no doubt in my mind, a twenty four carat bona fide masterpiece.\n",

Only in case of need, cold revenge or even summary justice (punishment of traitors for instance). Besides this they all have normal family lives with most cherished spouses and children and are usually very religious making pompous wedding, christening and funeral ceremonies in the Church or under priests' directions. This reality and atmosphere is splendidly shown in this movie that Coppola directed in a superb way and with a competent and strong hand. The cast has a stupendous performance. Marlon Brando plays a magnificent part in the role of the old godfather of one of American powerful mafia families, mastering his intonation and facial expression effectively thus creating an unforgettable character in the history of cinema. The action unfolds itself along the movie in a very captivating way. I want to stress particularly the sequence of the christening in which the new family godfather (Al Pacino) makes all the oaths in the name of the child (of whom he is also the Catholic godfather) and before the priest while a parallel cut shows us all the time a series of murders of rival mafia chiefs that were taking place at same time in several other places and which had been ordered by himself.

Although it is one of many Francis Ford Coppola masterpieces, this movie stands apart from the others. By telling the Corleone story from the inside of the family and mafia, viewers easily identify with and care about the characters. The cinematography is amazing too, and some of the shots and scenes from this movie can be considered the best of any movie throughout time. You can see IMDb's 9.2 rating of The Godfather and hear about the movie as often as you want, but until you experience the power of this film yourself, it will be impossible to grasp the importance of the movie to cinema. Although this movie is from the early 70s, it is by no means dated. Michael Corleone is my personal favorite character of all time, and the chance to see James Caan, Robert Duvall, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and John Cazale work together is unforgettable.

Trying to watch it the other day on TV I can't imagine anyone being able to follow it. Too many characters, too many subplots, and a very slow pace. I've been watching films my whole life, and frankly I can't tell a good screenplay from a good performance from a good director. I do know that if I like the plot and the story engages me I'll be sure to like the movie. In the Godfather, scenes and characters come and go with no discernable point. I believe it's a lack of continuity or flow. Brando calls in Luca Brasi to keep an eye on someone. Luca is then seen in a small apartment in sideview getting dressed and then packing his gun. Then we see him go into a bar or restaurant that we've never seen before. In a flash there's a knife in his hand and a wire around his throat. Apparently the character was introduced for the soul purpose of getting murdered. Pacino and Annie Hall are having a meal in what looks like a hotel. She has the most impossible hair style I've ever seen in any movie bar none. They seem to be saying good bye and next we see Pacino walking down a street and into a dark building that we've never seen before. He seems to get agitated and notices that in one room a half eaten sandwich on the table and the other rooms seem deserted. Running up and down corridors we now have no idea where he is or what he's doing. Suddenly he opens a door to what looks like a apartment and we see Brando lying on a hospital bed. Out of nowhere a nurse appears. The audience has no clue that this was a hospital. All it would take was a sign saying Emergency Room or Surgery. Then to involve the plot suddenly a dozen police cars appear in front of the building. The Captain says he was the one who told the guards and detectives to leave. And now he shows up with more. And all this is just a plot devise to have Pacino shoot him and the other mobster.\n",
            "There are countless meetings in this film that could have easily taken place over the phone.\n",
            "The cars, the costumes, and the scenes all seem very accurate. But this film is like an endless dramatic story without end. Doesn't it remind you too much of the ending in Apocolypse Now with the same director years later?\n",

            "Review 560: Prometheus, gave fire to humanity, a cherished and imperative gift for a foolish civilization that much needed it. Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo also gave a gift to humanity, a gift that should be the object of study of film students, an epic and dramatic visual tale for film lovers, and an incentive to appreciate cinema in its brightest and purest form for those who are willing to forget their lives for a little under 3 hours.The Godfather never gets old, and I believe it never will. It has withstood the test of time and never truly feels like a film of over 40 years of history. At times, this masterpiece begins to resemble fine wine, seemingly acquiring a better taste as it ages on.Its dialogue profoundly feels like discourse directly taken from the streets of New York at the beginning of the century. The cinematography and the acting feel exceptionally natural, and along with a cohesive and coherent pacing, these components make the flow of the film feel like a river in its calmest days: smooth, beautiful and noble. Every shot in the film faithfully serves a greater purpose; every shot feels like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle that never breaks apart.The ambition of the storytelling surpasses, I believe, its own expectations. It provides a sense of wonder, of fascination, nothing short of admiration. Despite having seen the film for over easily 30 times, every time I place my eyes and ears over that glorious opening scene, I can't help but feel like a child going to the beach for the first time, or a teenager going on a road trip; I feel a roller-coaster under my seat in its peak, waiting slowly to descend into the sublime. Very few stories can relate in terms of value.The characterization manifests itself over the course of a film in brilliant ways, exploiting the strengths and weaknesses of every one of its characters superbly. Even the minor characters have moments of spectacle. The motivations of each character come to life in outstanding takes, and not one of them ever truly feels expendable.The Godfather is a colossus, perhaps the summit of filmmaking. It is something every individual can appreciate, from its little details to its grand climax. It is something to be remembered for generations to come. It is something that will likely be unmatched for a great many years.\n",

            "Review 561: The entire scale for this movie is huge, and every scene carries emotions with it. The acting is amazing, as is the score and direction. So, what's wrong with it?SPOILERS FOLLOW\n",
            "First of all, people get their hopes up so high when they see this film that, it's to the point, if it doesn't change their life it's considered to be boring and dated. But, also, people also down vote it when it threatens the popularity of their trendy LOTR flicks and other movies that make you 'cool' if you like them.Acting - Brando was so subtle and yet had such a dramatic impact on the way acting was done. I have images from this film that I remember, and mostly I remember Brando holding the cat in the opening scene. His voice has influenced modern film and television - as almost every show on television has paid homage to the father of all film. Score - The score is haunting, and somber in all aspects of the word. It builds emotional tension and it has a pay off. The main theme is amazing and is beautifully put together and is always in the right context when it shows up in the film. It's beautiful, and I strongly urge you to get the original soundtrack.Direction - Francis Ford Coppola took a very subtle and consistent approach in bringing this film to life. Think of Michael in the diner with Captain McCluskey and Sollozzo, as the train is perfectly timed in going by, before Michael (in Al Pacino's career making performance) explodes with rage. It is so apparent in his face, and we feel as he does -- nervous yet we still anticipate. Story - The script is very well written, adapted from the brutal book by the brilliant Mario Puzo. The story of the film was ahead of it's time - and it still is. While being played on television today there are still people who refuse to like this simply because it's hyped. They try to go against anything that's popular in an attempt to look cool. It doesn't work - so give me The Godfather over Pulp Fiction (and all of the hip crime film copy cats that it spawned. i.e. The Usual Suspects [which is ranked higher than ON THE WATERFRONT] -- what is wrong with our society?)\n",
            "Everything is perfect as we become immersed in the world of the mafia boss Don Vito Corleone, and we're along for the ride as well follow him through a few years of his life. This film changed the way I saw art within movies.\n",
            "Yes, I hated it the first time I watched it. But, for some reason, felt I should watch it again. On the second viewing it was confirmed; I hated it. I trashed it everywhere, including on this site, and made it sound like the worst movie ever made. Boy, how much I've grown. I trashed it because I didn't want to be caught up in the frenzy this movie has produced. It created a whole spawn of copy-cats and followers trying to capture the art as The Godfather did, and sadly, it will never happen. This will never be duplicated or surpassed in any sense. From start to finish I am completely captivated at the imagery, the music, the brilliant acting, and the underlying script that holds so much warmth, and brutality.For any true fan of film - do not hate this simply because you want to be 'different' from others and look like some sort of outsider since you went against society by not liking a great movie just to prove how original you are. Face it, you're not original - you're doing the same thing others have done when it comes to this film for years, and as I once done as well. All of these kids who hate this film will have the hip movies in their best of lists, and you can figure out their personality from reading them.Their lists will have these films on it:The Shawshank Redemption (another reason why people try to hate The Godfather; Shawshank is their favorite film and it burns them inside to see The Godfather best it in the top spot)Fight Club (hip and trendy, violent and against society. What more could an angst filled teenager want?)LOTR (The scenery is beautiful, but turning everything into some sort of contrived melodrama because the script calls for it is ridiculous; this is by no means the best film ever made. It's a flavor of the month that will die out as time goes by and people realize the acting is horrible.)Etc, etc, etc. It seems like it's cool to dislike The Godfather films because it makes you look like some sort of 'rebel.' Trust me, Spock, it doesn't make you look like you're cool; it makes you look very stupid.\n",

If you make it through the second time (it's an acquired taste) think about it, think about the profound story it expresses, the emotions it throws into scene after scene after scene, inviting us to consider, and even feel, the pain they are all going through, and the love and happiness they often share with their, you guessed it, family.Don't like this movie? I'll make YOU an offer you can't refuse: a hip trendy blow-em-up-shoot-em-up flick with no moral value and no merit at its core.\n",

To me, the only films that come close are Apocalypse Now and Rashomon (in the woods - Akira Kurosawa)But, before you trash this film -- do what I did: give it an honest chance and forget the hype. After a while you will realize the hype was there for a reason, this film is amazing and will continue to be looked at as the best film to ever be made, regardless of what anyone has to say about it. Say it's dumb, say it's long and boring, yeah yeah yeah, you've got ADD, go watch commercials. They're easy to understand and yet so informative. If anyone actually thinks this movie deserves more than a 6 in rating it is disturbed. No professional film goer (someone who has seen over 100,000 films) would EVER say this movie was horrible. Goodfellas is just a mundane rehash of everything The Godfather had already perfectly portrayed. It's a good film in its own right, but could never match The Godfather. Sure, it's hip -- let's get some of that so people will invite us to the mall so we can check out the latest ORIGINAL clothing that everyone else that's trying to be original is wearing! Oh, a shirt that says \"you laugh because I'm different, I laugh because you're all the same.\" What a wonderful paradox; there's a million cliche'd teenagers out there wearing that shirt now, thinking they're original for doing it - but yet it's a mainstream shirt that everyone has.

            "Review 562: This film leaves one big question behind: Why the hell is it rated no.1 in IMDb?? There is no basic storyline, sometimes some people are being murdered but nobody knows why, you can't even say if the acting is good or bad because they run around with hats and sad faces all the time. From the beginning you simply sit there, waiting for some kind of message or at least some sense - and then after a much too long time the film is over. Why did they kill Don's friend? Why did they try to kill Don? Why did their enemies know that his son was driving to the husband of his sister? Where from did they know the one of the sons was in Italy? Why do they kill all the time at all? And where is the police I was wondering all the film. Lots and lots of murders, no police. Hm. It's nothing more than a bad 70's Mafia-trash-film.\n",

The movie is just so darn boring and the only reason I kept watching it was because I kept wanting it to get better. I know a movie is not all about action, but come on, who wants to watch a movie that is just all talk and no action. Look at Scarface and The Untouchables, those were good Mafia movies. They both had a great storyline, great acting, and had at least some action. The Godfather is just way to boring and I don't get why it is number on the all time list. Some reviews that didn't like this movie have said many people like this movie because its about the Mafia and its influence. Those people who have said that are absolutely right. The only reason I don't give this movie a 1 is because Marlon Brando and Al Pacino's performances were pretty darn good, but the story itself which carry's the movie is just so darn boring and this is without a doubt the most overrated movie ever. I'll stick to the Star Wars Saga instead of the Godfather Trilogy.\n",

            "Review 565: Without the Godfather cinema is missing its backbone.  Often heralded as the greatest movie in history, I would not dare disagree.  This is the only flawless material this world has ever made.  The script could not be better even if Shakespeare wrote it.  The direction could not be better if Spielberg directed it.  The acting could not be better if a gun was held up to the head of each actor.  Marlon Brando gives the single greatest performance by an actor this millenium, winning the best actor oscar hands down.  It just goes to show the entire world no actor has ever been better (On the Waterfront, A Streetcar Named Desire, Viva Zapata...)  Al Pacino was also stunning in his early career and showed signs of becoming the best actor of his generation (which he is, just barely ahead of De Niro and Hoffman).  James Caan and Robert Duvall also put in stellar performances which garnered oscar nominations for them both.  The Godfather should be studied in school to show what the partnership of perfection and complete mastery can do for a picture.  This movie is not at all matched by it's sequel or any other movie for that matter.  I would give my left arm to go see it on theater (c'mon i can't give my right arm i need that to press play and watch it at home).  No accomplishment by Da Vinci in innovation or Van Gogh in art can match what the Godfather has done for cinema.  Nearly number one on every single famous list in the world its an inspiration.  Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) shows such insight and power in leading a family I wouldn't mind letting him run America as President.  I own three copies of this movie one for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I recommend this movie for anyone who can breathe.  rating\u0011/10.

            "Review 566: Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)\n",

            "Review 567: It's very easy to let high expectations get the better of you when you watch a film. Maybe the film is perfectly fine, but nowhere near as good as you had expected, and so you are left with a bitter taste in your mouth when sans these expectations you would have had a fine few hours (looking at you, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). Or maybe your expectations are simply too high for any film to realistically meet. The Godfather could have easily fallen into one of these two categories. After all, when it comes to films that carry high expectations, it's hard to top The Godfather. And yet, in spite of all that, the film is still a masterpiece that enthralled me for all 3 hours of its runtime. Trust me when I say this film is one of those classics that has earned its legendary reputation. Almost everything about in this film is done to great effect. Even things I don't usually notice (unless they're really bad) like the editing and the sound design are done masterfully, the score is not only beautiful but the film knows when not to use the score and let the tension build, and of course you can't talk about The Godfather without talking about the legendary director and cast. With Francis Ford Coppola at the helm of Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duval, James Caan, John Cazle and Diane Keaton, and an amazing story on top of that it really shouldn't surprise anyone this film is as good as it is. There are so many more things I could say to sing this films praises, and so many more things that deserve praise, so many amazing scenes and so many memorable moments/lines, but really, you should just see the film yourself.10/10\n",

            "Review 570: What a movie this is? Like a ride and a half. Only coming to view it again last year, after last seeing it, I'd say, early 1990, late 89' this movie I've watched a few more times, again the other night, has grown on me. It's undoubtedly a masterpiece that deserves it's place of respect as one of the great movies of all time. Ironically the film was on GO the night after I've video'd it again. That just shows ya, what a classic this is. They don't make films like this anymore. The acting is high calibre. I loved James Caan in this as the hot headed brother who meets his demise in one of three bloody scenes, the most notably of course, that horrifyingly violent scene with the horse head, in the bed of a movie producer refuses to play ball. If you want a favor, like a wrong to be righted, talk to the Godfather, (an unparalleled performance by the late great Marlon Brando, who died penniless at 145 k's-hard to believe) can solve all your problems. Brando in this, just shows ya as in other films like Apocalypse Now, he's just the consummate actor. He must of inspired so many wannabe's. Of course the great discovery of a young talent, who soon would become an acting legend/role model, was of course Al Pacino, as Michael Corleone who when we first meet him, he's not part of his mafia family. In fact, he somewhat despises it. It's the choice he makes later on, after a near death experience with a loved one, where in his eyes, payback is warranted, even though, he quotes \"Never personal\". He becomes one of them, after brazenly taking out a crooked cop, and the head of another mafia family, responsible for the execution on his father, Don Corleone, (Brando), a tough cookie, surviving five close shots. What resilience this guy has, proving some guys are just lucky, or hard to kill. All the emotions, Pacino shows, nervousness, agitation, as he braces himself to make his first kills, were so believably intense, not overacted, just nice, perfect even. Pacino then vacates to Sicily for a year, to wait for the heat to cool down, where he marries a Sicilian beauty. I couldn't believe Diane Keaton, always terrific, and so good (fine) in this, escaped an Academy award nomination. She was just as good as most of the excellent leads. Watching Caan kick the crap out of his sister's abusive husband, was a guilty viewing pleasure. Caan really impressed me here. I won't tell you the last scene of this movie, but it involves a big fat lie, from Pacino, when asked a one time question by Keaton, which impactfully stayed with me, where if I was Pacino, for me, answering \"Yes\", would be an impossibility. There's some things you don't see coming in The Godfather, and the story takes different paths throughout the film. The cinematography is of course, first rate, and I love the interior shots in the Don's office, and again, here's a mafia film, that has me craving Italian. Although it's occasionally violent, most of it's pretty graphic too, oh that blood so under colored, more orangy red, flowing, it will always stand as the no one mafia film. God help us, if something of it's ilk, better's it.\n",

            "Review 571: Francis Ford Capolla's The Godfather is perfect, faultless and gripping. This film will really not stop sticking you to your chair. Al Pacino's second feature film and no doubt his best. His character is lovable and thrilling.It all begins when The Godfather (Marlon Brando) is granting favours, on the day of his daughters wedding. It is a tradition, not to deny a wish. Chaos is caused and problems occur. Problems which cause his oldest son Sunny (James Caan) to take over his role temporarily. Sunny, being the aggressive and annoyed one of all the sons. Causes something else to occur. Each problem causes another. The adopted son Tommy (Robert Duvall) is a lawyer and is capable of making a small portion of the problems disappear. This movie is literally gripping, no matter how tired or annoyed you are. This will still end up being your number one favourite movie; and Al Pacino is Michael, the youngest son, and probably his fathers favourite. He gives a perfect performance. With other brilliant actors through out the film (John Cazalle, Dianne Keaton) this film is, I will say it again, perfect! I STRONGLY recommend this movie to absolutely anyone and everyone.

            "Review 575: Such is the outlandishness and exuberance of The Godfather, that it is able to branch one of its more lower key characters off onto a tangent that is detached from the primary narrative strand based in New York, in the 1950s and sees the film revolve around the Corleone Family; and have this character shifted to the Italian island of Sicily as he lays low; meets new people and ultimately feels raw human emotion. He learns this through falling in love and suffering a sudden tragedy, an event that shocks both him and us, the audience. Such is the grand scope of the film whilst the character is Michael Corleone, the actor is Al Pacino and the film is The Godfather, a setting up of a grand tale revolving around an organised crime outfit in the latter years of the 20th Century.Michael is, of course, laying low because of the organised hit on certain individuals he put himself up to back in New York. I think up to that point, Michael had been a character involved, but not in a particularly spectacular manner, in the film but that consequent event and 'hiding' embeds him into 'the life'; it is his own point of no return that captures the essence of loyalty to one's family when the chance arises to show your worth, but at the same time acts as a demonstration of how easily it is for these people to, despite telling most involved that they're 'straight', get involved in the nastier side of life that others close to them are ultimately involved in.The series' sprawling, but in a good sense, study of life in crime several decades ago begins with 1972's The Godfather and at the rather distinct locale of a wedding, perhaps signifying what all weddings should signify: a beginning, a new beginning as the long and unknown road lies ahead  there will be good times, great times but bad times as we advance into the supposed unknown. Such is a synopsis of either Mafia life and the healthy-one-minute-dead-the-next ideation of life in organised crime as well as life following marriage as you venture off into the next chapter with 'the one' at your side. The scenic and pleasant setting of the wedding sees the film immediately establish a juxtaposition of the pleasant; of the upbeat and of the enjoyable clashing with the fact behind closed doors, despite the occasion, gangsters lurk discussing sordid prior activity and acts of brutal retribution in light of these acts.Initially, I think we're supposed to assume the film is about the very man sitting in his office; listening to stories delivered by people who do not (cannot) demand, but crave, action. The Don, Vito Corleone (Brando), sits and listens to whether the situation demands attention. Eventually he deems the immediate opening tale worthy of such Mob retaliation but for a favour in the future. There is a certain nonchalance, an establishing of power in these first scenes, that being before it branches out into the wedding and then into life amongst the Corleone family itself. Additionally, it is said that Vito has contacts in the music industry while a certain humane side to Vito is brought through via the fact it's established he brought into the family an orphan off of the street.But while Vito is the most powerful and the most inspirational character in the film, it isn't necessarily about him. Indeed, early on his adopted son Tom Hagen (Duvall) is engaging with others more than most others, a right hand-man for Vito and a lawyer all the same as he hears and helps deal with the issues and problems that arise for the family. But no, the film isn't really about him either rather it is about organised crime as a whole and how it engulfs these people and what they do. Too much happens in the film to list here, but it is a film driven not by pre-figured plot routines but by acts of honour, betrayal and the realistic decisions made by characters we believe are true to life or 'real'. They act on impulse but stay true to the consistency of their mindsets with Michael's sudden urge to take part in an organised 'hit' acting as a particular event, not because Michael is any sort of protagonist and must propel action, but because prior events to do with a targeted and consequentially injured character and Michael's attitudes to this injured character have built up a certain antagonism within Michael's usually cool mindset.Amongst all this, Michael's romance with a woman named Kay (Keaton) is slotted in rather nicely and, like everything else, is developed at its own pace with assured direction from Coppola. The film doesn't really posses an overly complicated narrative and the events are told in a linear format, but the achievement is in getting across this epic sense of progression. It is the getting under the skin of a lifestyle that we watch, the emotional and natural progression of a family, only difference being that this family are a New York based Mafia organisation but with an equally fascinating tale to tell.\n",

            "Review 577: Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all \"gangster movies\" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a \"Jewish Godfather\"; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an \"Oriental Godfather\"; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a \"modern day Godfather\".If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it.\n",

The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes.\n",

            "Review 579: How does one begin to describe a film like The Godfather? Many call it a \"masterpiece,\" and I disagree with them. A masterpiece implies perfection and, in my opinion, no film will ever achieve perfection. But The Godfather comes pretty damn close.Most already know the story of The Godfather. It's a narrative that's complex, yet simple and it's story that's fluid and interesting. It's complicated, but the story is told with such ease, it's like watching a master artist at work. The Godfather is superb storytelling at its finest.The story's fluidity has very much to do with the characters. The men of the Corleone family are all distinct and interesting, due to the stellar performances. Of course, the standout here is Marlon Brando as Vito, the aging Patriarch of this crime family. He's simply magnificent whenever he's on screen. That's not to discount the other great performances from the rest of the cast, which includes Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert DuvallThe film is technically brilliant as well. The cinematography is stunning, with the more bright colors jumping off the screen, while the blacks set the mood well for darker story moments. The sound is more subtle in its accomplishments, but when you hear the chatter of machine guns, it makes your heart skip a beat.It's hard to pick my absolute favorite film of all time. I could easily say Lawrence of Arabia, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or Lord of the Rings. And I could also easily say The Godfather, as most others have done. But I don't like making such conclusive statements. But don't worry, Godfather. It's not personal. It's strictly business.\n",

Al Pacino as Michael Corleone, Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone, Francis Ford Coppola (Director), Mario Puzo, the author of the book \"The Godfather\" on which the movie is based on, Nino Rota (composer). This is a TRUE MAFIA FAMILY drama movie. Epic in scope while maintaining a patience and intimacy characteristic of Italian art cinema, THE GODFATHER is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of movies, television shows, and video games more than 30 years after its release.

I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind.

Two greatest actors from Hollywood (Brando & Pacino) and a director whose fame is worldwide. The two lead actors were actually chosen instead of Redford and Olivier for various reasons.There were lots of budget issues while producing this movie but Coppola handled them absolutely well. Apart from production cost, he had to handle few supporting cast who weren't actually actors but gangsters.The director did say in an interview that he had tough time asking a character to read a sentence in English.There are at least dozen movies (in my country alone) which inspired/copied this epic.So, the bottom line is if you haven't watched this yet then get a copy now.\n",

            "Review 585: In 1940's New York, Vito Corleone is the head of a powerful organised crime syndicate, but he is ageing, rival gangs are vying for control and the new racket - narcotics - offends him. Fiercely protective of his family and business interests, what does his future hold ?For me, this is the ultimate revivalist picture - nobody had made a gangster movie for ten years and from out of nowhere Coppola made this stunning, sweeping, moody and evocative classic which not only smashed box-office records but became (and still is) the definitive gangster film. Aside from the incredible style, what appeals to me most is the grand tragedy of the movie; although he's a crook, we can't help but admire Vito's world-weary pragmatism, moral code and love for his children, and shiver at Michael's descent from innocent to avenger to cold-blooded killer. Vito's acute sense of failure, particularly in the garden scene, is as heart-wrenching as any of the (memorable) action or suspense scenes. The whole movie is a catalogue of stunning sequences though - the opulent wedding-party, the horse's-head-in-the-bed, the deserted hospital (my favourite), Sonny's bullet-ridden death on the causeway, the assassination in the cafe, the final montage intercut with the christening - all simply breathtaking. The performances are sensational, with many great little bits by the lower-order players (Marley as the bigoted studio boss, Lettieri as the kingpin, Castellano as the cheery Clemenza, Montana as the unfortunate Luca Brasi), but for me, Brando is the heart of this film. He's not my favourite actor - he's a bit pretentious in his angry young man roles and totally loopy in his later ones (see The Missouri Breaks), but this is a masterful performance. He makes the Godfather both real and mythical, simultaneously open-hearted and enigmatic; a rare lead role of a thoughtful old man who, despite all of his courage, power and intelligence, the world ultimately passes by. It's a sensational piece of acting. His line, \"I refused to be a fool, dancing on the string held by all those bigshots.\", sums up both his character and the genius of Coppola. The richness of this universal theme is beautifully enhanced by Nino Rota's gorgeous, melancholic score, and the sheer quality of the amazing imagery. This is an incredible tapestry of a picture; an unprecedented critical and commercial success, the grandfather of all movie-brat blockbusters, the most influential crime story ever filmed and an unmissable treat for all connoisseurs of great cinema. Scripted by Coppola and Mario Puzo, from Puzo's bestselling novel. My two favourite pieces of trivia - the writers censored the word mafia from the screenplay, and the baby in the christening sequence is the director's daughter and respected filmmaker in her own right, Sofia Coppola.\n",

Few men and women that had appeared in this production had ever made a more impressive performance. If there is any fault with the movie it would be the violence. I don't think that the subject could be relayed with any less and still depict the type of people being presented. The scene with the horse in the producers bed is gruesome, but the subjects are of that caliber. It is one of those movies that has to be seen at least once if for no other reason than because it truly is one of the best films ever made.\n",

Whilst standing vigil with a nervous (!) friend of his fathers on the hospital steps he lights the other man's cigarette.  He seems to be taken back either by just how relaxed HE is or possibly something more deeper comparing the opening/closing of the lighter to the motion made by the trigger of a gun.Also note a moment shortly after this, following a punch he receives from a corrupt policeman, leaving him with a swollen jaw.  Michael Corleone sits amongst family and friends plotting the murder of two threats to the family business.  He is calm and calculated in his plotting, and even physically resembles his father (swollen jawed).How many other levels does this film go?\n",

            "Review 590: There is one thing that I've rarely heard anyone point out about the generic list of \"BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME\". You know what they are. No matter what organization or website lists them, the list is almost always the same. And the one thing that the supposed elite movies of all time share in common: As far as story, they're all average. Not a single one of them has even a single scene of outstanding originality, or even flirts with it, for that matter. They're all generic paint-by-the-number dramas filled with pretty moving pictures and filled with people who can pretend to be someone else fairly well. But as far as story goes, these movies are all empty. There are a few exceptions—Star Wars, Pulp Fiction, a couple others—but that is a standard rule. The obsession with unoriginality that the pretentious men and women who chose what films are the best has always bothered me. And what better illustrates this than The Godfather? It is nothing but a generic crime drama, yet it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time? Something just seems wrong with that. Something seems wrong with the idea that the men who truly stand up and make original cinema get pushed to hell by critics, while a generic crime movie sits on the throne of God.Perhaps the perfect-scored reviews of The Godfather are right. On a technical level, on a storytelling level, on an acting level, The Godfather is perfection. The directing and production value so far surpasses everything from the early 70s, it's almost unbelievable. The storytelling is done flawlessly. I cannot think of a single 70s film where every single kill has so much value and weight. The acting is the stuff of legends. I will give The Godfather all of this credit, because it earns it. But . . .But none of that dismisses the fact that it is still simply a generic crime drama. No matter how well-done this story is told, it's a story that you've heard long before it was released. Unlike the modern gangster cinema, such as Ichi the Killer or Reservoir Dogs, The Godfather offers nothing new, even for its time. I understand that those examples I just listed are both meant to be taken as over-the-top and unrealistic, but my point still stands. People have created far more original and entertaining crime dramas than The Godfather. There is one subplot that I give this film some creative credit for—the horse—but beside that, this is just copy/paste plotting. If they had used the creativity of this scene more often throughout the movie, this truly would deserve the over-hyped credit it gets. Just because something is realistic does not mean it has to be unoriginal. Personally, I am Italian, and I have heard hundreds of real-life mob stories from my cousins, and they're all infinitely more interesting/creative than anything this film even touched. There is no excuse for The Godfather being as dry as it is.Some will argue that The Godfather is meant to be a drama about family life, not a thriller about crime. If that is true, and it may hold some truth, then The Godfather excels. Somewhat. As far as realistic emotion of family life, it's pretty solid and mildly cliché-defying. But it's nothing you haven't seen before, and seen with more compelling presentation.The other major flaw that is inevitable to ignore is the pure boredom that sets in every thirty minutes. I've read reviews stating that this modern generation simply can't relate to gangster films, thus it's boring. I've read reviews stating that the plot is generic, thus it's boring. Etc., etc., etc. All these may be valid reasons, but I think the point is this: The Godfather IS boring. It's filled with pointless conversation scenes that add nothing to the overall film or the generic plot or the drama, so what's the point of even including them? Pretentious-minded reviewers say that the viewer needs to be patient . . . Patient for what? Unlike Ridley Scott's Alien, there is rarely any payoff after the endless buildup in The Godfather. There is no entertainment value. While I'm completely fine with a film lacking entertainment value in order to show honest desperation or to intentionally offend, The Godfather does neither. All the reviews stating that this is a violent movie can be ignored. There is far more graphic violence in PG- and PG-13-rated movies of the past two years than this.With all the valid flaws I just listed, anyone calling this movie absolutely flawless is in denial. Or just has extremely low standards. While The Godfather is compelling and has masterful plotting and directing, it is simply just another face in the unoriginal crowd when you look at the big picture.Perhaps it was very influential in cinema—why should that effect how you personally view the film? Just because pretentious \"film buffs\" claim it's flawless, can you really not think of a single film that you enjoyed more? \"CLASSIC\" is just a word slapped onto films that critics are brainwashed into appreciating. It has no bearing on the true artistic or emotional value. It really shouldn't even have any bearing on public opinion, but it does. Imagine with me a world where The Godfather had been critically hated. Do you really think it would still receive the high public ratings that it has now? I highly doubt it. No one makes up their own mind anymore; anyone who does is considered a mindless shock jock, no matter how valid their reasoning is. While the best reasoning I have read for why The Godfather—other than the generic \"good plot, good acting, etc.\"—is considered so great is, \"BECAUSE IT IS. SHUT UP.\" Maybe what they're really trying to say is, \"I have no idea why it's good, I've just been told so, and I forced myself to believe it.\" 4/10\n",

            "Review 593: Does anyone ever asked the question about what is the best movie ever made? The movie that never get wrong in conveying its history and get right on all the points? The film that is very close to the word \"perfection\"? Well, \"The Godfather\" parts 1-2-3 are undoubtedly the answer to this question. Separate the 3 movies and judge them separately is easy. Of course the 1st is where we get marveled, and the other two we had already noted some mistakes, but that's why the three movies together are not only a masterpiece from Francis Ford Coppola but also (perhaps) the best story ever told in a movie.While in the 1st part, we are introduced to the Italian mob-family the Corleone's facing various threats from rival mob-families. That forces Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) tries to push his youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), to be his successor and be the next family's godfather; In part 2, we have the exact continuation of the story of Michael in the power of the family trying to raise the family business to other countries but he ends up making mistakes along the way. And simultaneously, we have the story of the young Vito Corleone (Robert De Niro) showing how he came to America and started raising his family; And finally the 3rd and last part we see a older Michael Corleone, suffering from mistakes that he committed in the past. But now he tries to redeem himself before his children Anthony (Franc D' Ambrosio) and Mary (Sofia Coppola) and his family trying to finally legalize the family business going into business with the Vatican and elect his nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia) as the new family godfather. But the dangers have always followed the Corleone's closely.As I said, all parts form the masterpiece that Mario Puzo (Screenwriter) and Francis Ford Coppola (director and screenwriter) brought to the world with his vision of the Italian mafia. Many criticize the film by worshiping the Italian Mafia, which it technically does, but the way that both genius explore it is fantastic.Throughout the history of the Corleone's, Coppola and Puzo explore the life and business of the mafia and how it works, demonstrating the business and the wars between the Mafia families that are shown realistically and terrifying. BUT, it is not just a story of violence and tragedy as many accuse (which is 60 % of it), because as the film progress it raises throughout the history various concepts of honor, justice and family, all revolving around the Corleone. Making the public really feel part of the family and start to worry about each family member in all parts of the story, at the same time with the family business and his honor.The writing from Puzo and Coppola help much in this regard. The script is extremely \"perfect\" in all parts. The narrative is so superb that it never gets boring or leave loose ends, and always raise the values of honor and family through the best dialogs ever put on film. But Puzo and Coppola can make these long dialogs in simple conversations between human beings facing their problems, putting ourselves in their situations and relating with them, leaving the film more exciting and engaging.But Coppola not only explores the Italian mafia and their families but also puts at various points in American history: the first part is right after the 2nd World War and Michael is a war hero returning home, but he ends up becoming the godfather from his family; on the 2nd part in the history of young Vito Corleone we see him coming in America at the time of the great Italian immigration meeting the \"American Dream\"; on the 3rd part with Michael going into business with the Vatican we see a huge line of corruption and murder within the church .Both in writing and directing the film is excellent too but the performances are the highlights of the movie: Al Pacino is excellent in every detail with a penetrating gaze and frightening expressions (and still annoys me that in 3 films he didn't get a Oscar for his role); Robert De Niro is a perfect young Vito Corleone in both voice and gestures reminding us of the badass and unforgettable old man from the first part with a simply perfect performance from Marlon Brando.Many say that the 3rd part should never be connected to the first two for be to horrible. I think the film is still a masterpiece but obviously it has his inconveniences leaving loose ends like: what happened with Tom (Robert Duvall), the family's lawyer, he died or he started his own family as he wanted in part 2? And also adds a lot of plots and little development, at least in the 1st hour of the film. But after a huge chopper scene everything settles superbly and concludes the trilogy or rather the film perfectly.Simply putted is the best movie ever made, the drawbacks and inconveniences are almost invisible (except in the 3rd part). Concepts of honor and family within the Mafia; full of suspense and drama; criticizes America and the church. All this in a movie with excellent performances, direction and writing simply perfect. All that makes \"The Godfather\", the strongest brand of cinema till today10/10\n",

What could be more appealing to people (even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection. The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable! Overall rating: 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 595: This classical story of a Mafia family is classified as one of history's greatest movies, and without surprise, The Godfather truthfully lives up to the continuous reverence it deserves and thankfully receives. It's very long, but it's seriously an amazing crime tale guaranteed to keep you absorbed. However, some audiences will certainly ask what elements are placed throughout this 70s drama to collect such extraordinary fame.Well the talented Al Pacino delivers a simply phenomenal performance in this love letter to fans of crime classics, executing the son of the head of a Mafia family who is provided with his father's role. All the other actors and actresses are stunning, too. Another factor of the film that's entirely unthinkable for someone to dislike is definitely the classical soundtrack and theme. A lot of credit needs to belong to Nino Rota, who intelligently wrote the stylish music.But wait, there's much more! Obviously the stunning visuals are loveable and so are the onscreen actions, but behind the camera, Francis Ford Coppola is responsible for the direction. Plus even though you've probably heard it more than a billion times, The Godfather is incredibly entertaining and a must-watch for Mafia movie lovers. See this masterpiece in the cinema with popcorn, in which you'll sense its effect all around you. But prepare yourself for the nearly-3-hour runtime, because it isn't quick. It's also a little overhyped...If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.\n",

Quebec Rating:13+ Canadian Home Video Rating:18AThe Godfather is the number 1 movie on IMDb's Top 250 movies list.It won best picture at the academy awards.It has been praised by critics and it spawned two sequels.I don't think it should be the number 1 movie in the Top 250(dont ask me what should because I am not really sure) but Godfather is a very amazing movie and its definitely in my Top 10 movie list.This is one of the first and greatest mafia movies ever made.It has excellent acting, an excellent storyline, it is a great adaptation of a great book, it has an all star cast of Marlon Brando,Al Pacino,James Caan,Robert Duvall,Talia Shire,Diane Keaton and others.I can see why some people may not like it.I can see it being boring for some people but I find it one of the few long movies that keep me interested until the end.The movie is about a mafia don, who gets shot and this sparks a war between the five mafia families of new york.Their son Michael(Al Pacino) is an army veteran who does not want to get involved in the family business but ends up being the don(sorry about the spoiler).The movie has a great ending as well.This movie was fairly violent for 1972 but is tame by today's standards.In conclusion the godfather is an excellent mafia movie but it is a little overrated.Godfather Part 2 is almost as good, Part 3 is not as good as the first two but still good despite what most think.\n",

I'm shocked to be honest, what an awful, awful movie this is and I don't say that a lot about movies since I tend to appreciate what they are and what they are trying to convey, but this? This is an embarrassment and has to go down as the most overrated movie of all time in my book. There's no good acting performances in the movie, no memorable lines, no excitement, nothing. I'm genuinely disgusted that this movie has such high accolades because to me, it's crap. Absolute crap.Brando's portrayal of Corleone has got to go down as one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen as well. The accent he uses is difficult to understand, the scene where he's shot in that assassination attempt is laughable as he over dramatizes the whole thing and his general acting performance and portrayal of Corleone, who is supposed to be a feared crime lord, is contrived and doesn't look believable. I'm honestly shocked that someone who is rated as one of the best actors who ever lived can perform this badly. This is the first film I've seen Brando in so I think it's unfair to judge his ability as an actor based on this poor performance, but my expectations will definitely be lowered when I watch another movie and see him as part of the cast.\n",

            "Review 599: When you think of the top 25 films of all time, they have one thing in common. You could have seen them when they first came out or your children's children can be viewing them, and they will still give the same long lasting impression. They may encourage you/your children to get into film or entertainment, they make you think. They keep you talking well after you've seen the film not once, not twice, but for a long time. There is always something new you're discovering about it, each time you speak of it. The Godfather is one of those rare films.I was too young to see it once it came out, but I read alot of movie magazines at the time about it as well as grabbing a copy of the Mario Puzio book. My first full length view of \"The Godfather\" was on...yep, you guessed it, the \"Z\" channel in Los Angeles in the 1980's. It grabbed me and never let go.The Godfather has everything in it that a movie going public would like to see, and the rare thing is -- it's all in one movie. It deals with family, the relationship of sons and their placement IN a family, it has violence -- that's for sure, mystery, romance, corruption, suspense. It has a story, surprises. The costumes are wonderful, the scenery and sets are wonderful.This was 1972 and NOTHING like this was put together/filmed at the time. The early 70's gave alot of film makers chances, some good, some spectacular -- and most of all a legend for future film makers and entertainers to look at, hold in esteem and copy (which is the best form of flattery.)Don't get me wrong, there are many 'gangster-type' films out there that kick-butt (thanks to James Cagney, Edward G. and a host of others) , but this one...flowed. It really isn't all about the violence, but legacies, how violence begats violence and a look inside a \"family\" maternal and extended and what they would do to survive. The rivalries between \"families\". This is why \"The Godfather\" ranks in the top 7 of the best movies of all time among the majority. Francis Ford Coppola, Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Cann, Robert DuVall and an ecclectic, well cast group of actors and actresses and Production crew brought this to life. Regardless of how YOU may feel personally about the \"portrayal\" of the ethnicity of the characters, this film MAKES you wonder, makes you feel, makes you angry, makes you cry, makes you respond.The Godfather is one of the best films ever made.\n",

            "Review 600: The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the \"premiere\" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia \"order.\"\n",

Movies like Goodfellas, Casino, Donnie Brasco, Carlitos way and Scarface are all amazing films and make this movie seem like a lullaby because it's enough to put you to sleep with its extremely slow and gentle pace.

I've seen many better movies than this one, whatever angle I choose: story, screenplay, acting, direction, camera, moral points, invention, anything. I don't get its n°1 rating. I suspect many people praise it out of mere conformism.Most of Kubrick's movies are better than this, a couple of Polanski's ones too, just to name a few. Other great classics like \"12 angry men\" or \"Network\" easily surpasses \"The Gofdfather\" both artistically and technically by a fair margin, not to mention more courageous, independant works like \"Brazil\" or \"Citizen Kane\".Excellent movie, for sure, but best movie? Ouch. Its n°1 rating maybe comes from... consensus?Just my 2 cents...\n",

            "Review 604: The first Godfather movie may be over 43 years old but still holds up well after all of these years. The film is at heart a story of family. It is the story of Vito Corleone and his three sons, Santino (Sonny), Frederico (Fredo), and Michael. It is also the story of Vito's other family, the mafia. The story focuses on Michael, the youngest son. At first, he wants nothing to do with the family business but as the film progresses, he is drawn more and more into it and by the end, he is running the family - both families. The transformation of Michael from family outcast to Godfather is fascinating to see. Al Pacino does a wonderful job of transforming from playful young man to fearsome gangster. Without going into too much detail so as not to ruin the movie for those few who have never seen it, several scenes stand out: The horses head is probably the most famous, or infamous, and has been used in homage and parody by many others in the years since the movie was released. When I rank the best movies I have seen, the original Godfather is always number one on my list.\n",

            "Review 615: The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a \"movie\" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen. You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family. The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another. Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.\"I never listened to the big shots holding all the strings. But I hoped that someday you would be the one holding on the strings.\"\n",

Very professional! I had a nice time watching this, but my main critic is the pace and the length.

This film has it all - an extremely powerful, believable story, an all-star cast and a director (Francis Ford Coppola) who made the effort and took the time to do it right! The story is of a Mafia family in the 30's through the 60's and the events that catapult a son into control of the family's empire. Al Pacino, in particular, did a fantastic job as Michael Corleone, son of his father, although he didn't intend it to be that way. There is a lot of violence, but it's not there for violence's sake. The world of organized crime was much more violent in the past than it seems to be now and the violence is depicted as more or less just a part of doing business. This is perhaps Marlon Brando's greatest performance (as the father) ever. Other great actors include James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire.

I saw it on original release in the Netherlands on a weekday afternoon with perhaps 5 people in the theater...when Michael killed the cop and the gangster and walked out right before the intermission, you could hear everyone in the theater gasping from the relief of pent-up breath. The Godfather has one of the great goofs ever shown. In the scene where Sonny beats up Carlo on the street in front of Carlo's bookmaking operation, there's a shot of Sonny swinging a roundhouse right to the left of Carlo's face; you hear the impact on Carlo's face (nice Foley work), and Carlo's head is jerked to his right from that impact. It is all quite persuasive except for one thing: the camera was positioned directly to the side of the fight on a line at zero degrees of angle, and so you can clearly see Sonny's hand miss Carlo's face by at least 4 or 5 inches. A phantom punch! I get a kick out of this every time I watch the film.\n",

The 'boring' weeding scene is the 'highlight'.Michael is a 'wet fish' and his relationship with Kay is very dumb, and also 'stupid' and 'weird'. The Godfather scenes make me 'sick' and 'woozy'.

Both Puzo and Brest were largely let down thanks to this 'Tony Montana' The characters of Sonny and Fredo were so 'unrealistic' I thought they were 'comic book'. I must also highly criticize the music in this film as being 'childish' and sometimes often 'out of place'.Now on to some other failings of this 'pathetic' movie. The dialogue was 'silly'. If it was supposed to be nail-biting, well, it 'failed'. The manner in which the actors delivered their lines was 'uninspiring'. Brando in particular 'sucked'. What about the 'long' and 'tired' Sicily scenes? Reference to four hours of \"Lawrence of Arabia\" I don't know? The car exploding was so 'unoriginal' and 'clichéd'.

America has always had a romantic fascination with organized crime and this film takes us inside `the family' like never before.The script is nearly flawless.  The dialogue is engaging and emotional and the pace never lets up.  The story is mesmerizing.  The characters are so carefully and intimately developed that we can't help but get emotionally involved with them.  Though the violence is graphic and disturbing, it is never random or gratuitous and always has a direct link to a vital plot element.However, the appeal of this film goes beyond its great script to the characters and the actors who played them.  The ensemble has such amazing chemistry that it hard to imagine they are not actually related to one another.  They have such charisma that we fall in love with every member of this band of ruthless criminals, despite their moral decadence.  We come to understand that they are immoral by our standards, but not amoral, since they have their own codes of honor that they take very seriously.Though this was more of an ensemble piece than the sequels, two actors clearly stand out, namely Marlon Brando and Al Pacino.  Brando was already an established superstar at that point, although he hadn't had a meaty role in a few years.  His performance as Don Vito was powerful and commanding. Outstanding as he was, it was probably not his best performance (See `On The Waterfront', `A Streetcar Named Desire', or `Mutiny On The Bounty'), yet it is the one for which he is most famous.  Brando redefined our notions of the mafia patriarch from that of a ruthless dictator, to a shrewd diplomat who only wielded power when absolutely necessary.  He presented him as a potent but sympathetic character with a cunning mind and an astute understanding of the human dynamics of the other families.Pacino, in contrast, was a fresh face with only two films to his credit at that time.  Despite his lack of film experience, he delivered a tour de force performance portraying a complex character that required a great deal of range.  Michael Corleone starts as a goody two shoes and is ultimately hardened into a cold-blooded crime boss, with a touching romantic interlude along the way.  Pacino shined in every scene and established himself as one of the truly great actors of our time.Other standouts include Robert Duvall and James Caan, who was brilliant as the hot headed Sonny Corleone.  Caan's performance was raw, brutal and visceral, yet he somehow was able to render Sonny a magnetic and charming character with a strong sense of family loyalty.This film was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1973 and won three, including Best Actor for Brando and Best Picture.  It is one of the very few videos that I actually own.  It is hard to imagine that anyone born before 1982 hasn't seen it yet, but if you haven't, you should make it the very next film you see.  It is an utterly perfect 10.\n",

            "Review 628: Best movie in my category. Brando's acting is magnitudes above any best actors in Hollywood and in any other world theaters. I suspect Brando's brilliance is unmatched by anyone before and (I suspect) after him. For example, Pacino is superb but still Brando is head and shoulders above Pacino. I just love Brando's acting, he simply grabs you and take you to anywhere the movie wants you to.But a good movie is not only a good actor. The whole cast, the plot, the dialogs, the scenes and last but not least the director - Coppola are all near perfect. I thank GOD for bringing such talent to Hollywood as Brando and Coppola. Al Pacino is good but under Brando's brilliance his color did fade away a bit.The supporting actor - Robert Duval is also a superb actor. Even in this cold and bloody killing movie he brings warmth of family friendship, loyalty and cool-headedness to the audience and making this movie this much more gripping.The weight of a first-class movie is apparent starting from the first few scenes of the movie and lasted throughout the movie. Coppola knows how to grab audiences and move them up and down through the plot of the movie - a true master.It is hard to compare Coppola with Lucas. They are both wonderful directors of different classes of movies. But I believe Coppola can better bring depth and intricate emotions to audience than Luca. This makes him a more memorable director even after we all pass on.\n",

There we no special effects, no cookie cutter acts and scenes. It was a relief.A friend of mine, whose father left home when my friend was a little boy, adopted The Godfather as his missing dad. He watched it 25 times and quoted it throughout his life as the voice of a loving father who takes care of business. In a way it is scary, but also an amazing thing, that a film can raise a man.This movie has held the number one spot on my top ten list for most of my adult life.

            "Review 631: Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather is an elegant, epic and thrilling work, to a large extent worthy of all its praise.The cast is very impressive and everyone is doing a good job. Marlon Brando's performance as Vito Corleone is iconic even though I find his overly coarse voice and stuffed cheeks borderline comical. Perhaps the best thing about The Godfather is that, even though the characters are involved in some questionable activities, they aren't really made out to be bad guys; you keep cheering for the Corleones almost no matter what they do. Some people might use this as criticism but I think it is rather refreshing.Finally, the film is so well crafted in almost every aspect; the sound (particularly in the scene where Michael Corleone kills Sollozzo and McCluskey but also Nino Rota's score, of course), the cinematography (there are some stunning shots) and the aforementioned acting is all top notch. And yet, I think it falls a bit short of a masterpiece even though I have very few complaints. Perhaps it is a bit like with other classic works of art such as Stairway to Heaven and Mona Lisa; The Godfather has been so quoted and praised that it is hard to be completely blown away by it. Nevertheless, it is a solid and unforgettable film that should leave few people disappointed.\n",

            "Review 632: Popularly viewed as one of the best American films ever made, the multi-generational crime saga The Godfather is a touchstone of cinema: one of the most widely imitated, quoted, and lampooned movies of all time. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino star as Vito Corleone and his youngest son, Michael, respectively. It is the late 1940s in New York and Corleone is, in the parlance of organized crime, a \"godfather\" or \"don,\" the head of a Mafia family. Michael, a free thinker who defied his father by enlisting in the Marines to fight in World War II, has returned a captain and a war hero. Having long ago rejected the family business, Michael shows up at the wedding of his sister, Connie (Talia Shire), with his non-Italian girlfriend, Kay (Diane Keaton), who learns for the first time about the family \"business.\" A few months later at Christmas time, the don barely survives being shot by gunmen in the employ of a drug- trafficking rival whose request for aid from the Corleones' political connections was rejected. After saving his father from a second assassination attempt, Michael persuades his hotheaded eldest brother, Sonny (James Caan), and family advisers Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) and Sal Tessio (Abe Vigoda) that he should be the one to exact revenge on the men responsible. After murdering a corrupt police captain and the drug trafficker, Michael hides out in Sicily while a gang war erupts at home. Falling in love with a local girl, Michael marries her, but she is later slain by Corleone enemies in an attempt on Michael's life. Sonny is also butchered, having been betrayed by Connie's husband. As Michael returns home and convinces Kay to marry him, his father recovers and makes peace with his rivals, realizing that another powerful don was pulling the strings behind the narcotics endeavor that began the gang warfare. Once Michael has been groomed as the new don, he leads the family to a new era of prosperity, then launches a campaign of murderous revenge against those who once tried to wipe out the Corleones, consolidating his family's power and completing his own moral downfall. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards and winning for Best Picture, Best Actor (Marlon Brando), and Best Adapted Screenplay, The Godfather was followed by a pair of sequels\n",

            "Review 633: The Godfather is simply put a masterpiece. I would highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't had the chance to enjoy Coppola's best movie. First off, the actor's performances are top notch. Al-Gore especially does an amazing job as Michael, always wearing a serious face, really becoming a very professional gangster. The other actors also contribute immensely to the film but none stand out quite like Robert Duvall, Besides Al-Gore. From humble beginnings as Bo Riddley, Duvall really has come a far way as he plays the character of Tom Hagen, Lawyer of the mob. Next there's the shots. Almost all shots have a purpose, from the beginning shot over the godfather's shoulder to slowly approaching a man sleeping with his horse's head. Similar to how shots serve a purpose to the movies progression, so do props. An iconic prop from the godfather are the oranges. Coppola places oranges in scenes to foreshadow that something bad is about to happen, like when the godfather gets shot he's buying oranges! The sound track was also very well done. The violins really give a mobby feel and how the music built up during certain scenes really helped build up tension.(Spoilers) My favorite parts of the movie were when they hit the driver near the statue of liberty, when Michael kills the opposing mob boss and cop, The final scene when Michael closes the door on his girlfriend, and finally, my favorite, the epic finale where each mob boss is killed of one by one as Michael becomes a literal godfather to his sister's child and the godfather of the mob. Overall, I really enjoyed the Godfather for doing everything right, 10 out of 10\n",

Francis Ford Coppola just makes an amazing story like this come alive. It was made so that Francis could keep his studio running, Zoetrope, and probably didn't intend for it to be such a masterpiece it is. It's complete genius. Marlon Brando as the Godfather who gets a kiss on his hand and being told who should be killed, and getting lots of friendship from different people. Al Pacino, who is one of the most important actors of all time, is one of his sons, who is in the army, and not really into the family crime business unto soon enough. And other characters who make the Corleone family a one-in-a-million family, with astute heads. This is probably the, or probably one of my favorite movies of all time, just because it works, and is directed professionally, and perfectly. The acting puts a whole other atmosphere into this film.

I'm pretty sure it could have been shrunk down to 2 hours.There are some really good scenes in this movie. The hits that are made on various people were really well done for it's time. Don't get me wrong, you could see the blood wasn't real, but back when this was made i am pretty sure they didn't have the effects and make up we have now.The story was really good, but it was a very slow paced movie. It took a while for the movie to get going. There is a lot of dialogue and if you listen to it properly and get into the movie you will enjoy it.The Corleone family is a family you don't want to mess with. They take no prisoners. If you are their friends they will look after you, but if you get on their wrong side, you won't live long enough to regret it.The casting was really good. Marlon Brando played the Godfather, Don Vito Corleone. This was the best role he has played that I have seen so far. Al Pacino played his son Michael. A brilliant performance. He looks so young in this film... I nearly didn't recognise him. James Caan played another son, Sonny. I am not a huge James Caan fan, but he did well in this movie.The Godfather is not the best gangster movie I have ever seen. I think Goodfellas is still the best in my opinion. But I can understand why this is a classic. This was probably the first big gangster film.I loved the soundtrack too... the theme to this film is legendary. I have listened to it a lot. Slash plays it on guitar really well at his concerts.I will give this film a 7 out of 10.A good movie, but a mission to watch due to the length.

            "Review 640: I first saw this film the summer before my senior year in college, during a summer school class I was taking called \"Literature and Film.\"  This was the second film they showed, I think, and from the moment the character of Bonasera comes on and says, \"I believe in America,\" this had me hooked. This is like the perfect meal, where all the ingredients come together - theme (gangsters as a metaphor for society, family being overrun by cold-hearted business tactics), story, acting (Brando seemed a little overrated when I first saw it, but that's because he's not on-screen a whole lot; it took me a few viewings to see his shadow hangs over the entire film. The rest of the cast is excellent as well, especially Pacino), the technical sides (the way Gordon Willis uses light and dark to contrasts the two sides of the Corleones made me pay attention to cinemotography), dialogue (\"I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse\" \"Leave the gun, take the cannoli\") - and leave you completely satisfied.  And the scene I remember is not the horse's head, or the scene where Michael says he will kill Sollozzo and McClusky, but rather the baptism scene, which haunted me for days.

            "Review 644: The Godfather is a story surrounding an organized crime family named Corleone in the 1940's. The patriarch, Don Vito Corleone, his loyal son Sonny, his daughter Connie who marries the abusive Carlo Rizzi, and his legitimate son Michael who is not involved in the family business. When Michael returns home from the war and Don Corleone is nearly killed by a rival gang, he slowly finds himself being sucked into the life. Though many people will say The Godfather is the greatest movie of all time, it's not. To tell you the truth, it's not an exciting movie at all. It's not action packed, and not a whole lot happens in its 3 hour running time. However, it is a brilliantly made film with some amazing acting, and portrays the most realistic view of the mafia in film history.Let's start off with the acting. Al Pacino who is now recognized as one of the best actors of all time got his start as Michael Corleone in this film. The movie mainly focuses on his getting sucked into the family business. Al Pacino plays the role brilliantly showing both his tempted side and his reluctant side. All of the supporting actors in this film are awesome. There are really solid performances by James Caan as Sonny who has the coolest scene in the film, and Robert Duvall as Tom. Of course, nothing bad can be said about the late Marlon Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone. This is Brando's most famous role and for good reason. His genius portrayal will go down in history as one of the greatest acting jobs of all time.The realism of the film is what also makes it good. This is the most realistic view of the mafia you will ever see on film. Most mafia films portray the action side of the story with all the hit men and explosions and gunfights. The Godfather doesn't show a lot of that. It focuses mainly on the business side of things. It shows how serious mobsters really are about their jobs.So, even though The Godfather isn't the greatest film of all time, it's one of the best made.8.5/10\n",

            "Review 647: The remarkable thing about Mario Puzo's novel was the way it seemed to be told from the inside out; he didn't give us a world of international intrigue, but a private club as constricted as the seventh grade. Everybody knew everybody else and had a pretty shrewd hunch what they were up to.The movie (based on a script labored over for some time by Puzo and then finally given form, I suspect, by director Francis Ford Coppola) gets the same feel. We tend to identify with Don Corleone's family not because we dig gang wars, but because we have been with them from the beginning, watching them wait for battle while sitting at the kitchen table and eating chow Min out of paper cartons.\"The Godfather\" himself is not even the central character in the drama. That position goes to the youngest, brightest son, Michael, who understands the nature of his father's position while revising his old-fashioned ways. The Godfather's role in the family enterprise is described by his name; he stands outside the next generation which will carry on and, hopefully, angle the family into legitimate enterprises.Those who have read the novel may be surprised to find Michael at the center of the movie, instead of Don Corleone. In fact, this is simply an economical way for Coppola to get at the heart of the Puzo story, which dealt with the transfer of power within the family. Marlon Brando, who plays the Godfather as a shrewd, unbreakable old man, actually has the character lead in the movie; Al Pacino, with a brilliantly developed performance as Michael, is the lead.But Brando's performance is a skillful throwaway, even though it earned him an Academy Award for best actor. His voice is wheezy and whisper, and his physical movements deliberately lack precision; the effect is of a man so accustomed to power that he no longer needs to remind others. Brando does look the part of old Don Corleone, mostly because of acting and partly because of the makeup, although he seems to have stuffed a little too much cotton into his jowls, making his lower face immobile.The rest of the actors supply one example after another of inspired casting. Although \"The Godfather\" is a long, minutely detailed movie of some three hours, there naturally isn't time to go into the backgrounds and identities of such characters as Clemenza, the family lieutenant; Jack Woltz, the movie czar; Luca Brasi, the loyal professional killer; McCluskey, the crooked cop; and the rest. Coppola and producer Al Ruddy skirt this problem with understated typecasting. As the Irish cop, for example, they simply slide in Sterling Hayden and let the character go about his business. Richard Castellano is an unshakable Clemenza. John Marley makes a perfectly hateful Hollywood mogul (and, yes, he still wakes up to find he'll have to cancel his day at the races).The success of \"The Godfather\" as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn't miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone's daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garroting.\n",

            "Review 653: I gave it a 1/10 score because of the huge degree in which this film is overrated. My actual score for this film would be 9/10: excellent but not a masterpiece.It is a very good family melodrama, with very well constructed characters and excellent acting, however, I cannot say I loved this film. It is very good, but nothing really special: It is one of my top 100 favorite films, but not top 50. Why? The main flaw of this film is that it lacks visual art: the truly great films work as pieces of audiovisual art, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or Coppola's own Apocalypse Now. This film, by contrast, doesn't offer anything besides plot and characters. It is not artistically complete as it doesn't take full advantage of the medium of film.One problem with this type of film, that is, films restricted by plot, is that by being a film about a family and their petty criminal organization severely restricts the scope and greatness of the film. If, instead, the film was done in a post-apocalyptic setting, where Marlon Brando would be the ruthless leader of a small village in the vast wastelands, and Michael his heir, with a Mad Max 2 felling and more action, it would have been a 10/10 film, because it would have been way more epic. (yeah! :) mundane settings suck: :P )But, being a film restricted to a petty criminal organization, restricts its greatness: for me a great film needs a great theme and there is little that is lesser in greatness than a gangster theme. It is simply one of those \"american\" cultural constructs that do not fit in may world view: why one would be so interested in the lives of pathetic criminals?From a technical perspective this film is great, but from an artistic perspective this film is not that great, it is good, but not great. In conclusion: a very good film, but not a great one. Want a powerful drama? Anderson's There Will Be Blood is a way more powerful drama film than this one.\n",

            "Review 654: Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks—\"they are animals anyway.\"This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college- educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life—marriages, baptisms, family feasts—become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.\n",

The main thematic conflict is between good and evil and the decent to the dark side for the main character Michael. The movie has a great dichotomy between the purity of religion and crime. Francis Ford Copolla has directed a master piece in this first of the trilogy.\n",

            "Review 658: If there was one valuable and simple lesson that I learned from watching \"The Godfather\".  I learned that movies that are made like this are hard to resist watching.This film was based on the unforgettable novel by the late Mario Puzo and it was wonderfully adapted into the story that was written by Puzo himself and Francis Ford Coppola, who directed the film.The film is like the book itself, it's extraordinary and respects the subject that it focuses on.  Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are terrific in their roles and there are several scenes that left me both surprised and in awe.  Some of the violent moments aren't only graphic, but very grizzly as well.  The baptism massacre, one scene where Sonny (James Caan) is setup and is shot up like a piece of Swiss cheese, and another scene where Vito (Brando) is shot in public and Fredo (the late John Cazale) can't even shoot the two hoodlums best illustrate how ugly living in the Mob can get.Besides the other film that was directed by Coppola (\"Apocolyspe Now\") that I deeply cherish, this film has a great supporting cast and I've mentioned a few of those key actors.Even Coppola's daughter, Sofia, who would later star in the third \"Godfather\" film and have also directed her first film (\"The Virgin Suicides\"), is unbilled as the baby that is baptised in the church before the unpleasant massacre starts.\n",

            "Review 659: This is probably one of the most nearly perfect films ever made. A dark and twisted version of the \"immigrant to America makes good\" story is wonderfully presented. No small amount of credit for the quality of this movie should go to Mario Puzo's original novel. That novel helped make terms like \"make your bones\" and \"have a sit-down\" and \"capos\" popular. Francis Ford Coppola likes to dump on the whole \"gynecological repair job\" section of the novel but that seems like petty griping compared with the way that book gave him a can't-miss blueprint for the film. Coppola's change of the closing ceremony to a baptism instead of a confirmation was inspired but for the most part the book is so closely followed Puzo practically deserved a co-director credit.This film proved you don't need constant footage of guns blazing to make a successful and memorable gangster movie. The fact that it nicely retains the source material's sub-text ensured its greatness.\n",

            "Review 660: I really like the movie that was temporarily #1 - \"The Fellowship of the Ring\". I agree with a lot of what's in the charts though think some films here are over-rated. And this is what I felt about \"The Godfather\". It's very well made, etc. but it's also a bit boring.On a production level, it's hard to fault \"The Godfather\" and Coppola's handling of events. There's an intense level of detail, as he charts the rise of Vito Corleone to prominence, and the lengths people go to attain power. The direction is great - there's a real sense of epic-ness here. The city and times seem alive before you. There's a great sense of realism - helped, for example, by the use of speaking Italian in the movies because - hey Hollywood - not everyone would want to, or choose to, constantly speak English. It's rich and lush and has a quality nearly all films lack nowadays in their haste to please the lowest-common-denominator.The acting is spot on. In fact it's probably above that. It's excellent. Pacino is at his height here - wonderful as the naive Michael Corleone who has to learn the family trade. Marlon Brando's \"Vito Corleone\" has become so infamous that seeing him is almost like watching a caricature (as are many of the lines) but he's on fine form, though I preferred his fresher, more engaging role in \"On the Waterfront\".And yet for all the unquestionable production values and acting... I found it all a tad dull. I don't have an aversion to the genre - \"Goodfellas\" and \"The Sopranos\" are superb - but I found the pacing slow, almost monotonous in places. There is an attention to detail, and an epic scope, but that doesn't necessarily translate to interesting viewing. \"Lawrence of Arabia\" dragged me into the sweeping sands, yet I wasn't dragged in here to anything approaching the same degree. There's character development but, as we touch up and down upon certain moments in the lives of the Corleones, we're never given any sense of more fluid developments. We see their actions from a distance and find it harder to empathise or care about them. It all adds up to a muted viewing experience for me, and I felt indifferent to his hailed classic.I can't knock \"The Godfather\" too much, because it has a lot going for it. As one reviewer commented it, even those who don't like it feel forced to rate it highly because they must acknowledge the craftsmanship here. For all that I was quite disappointed by this movie and can only give it 8/10 (and that's because of the talent involved). The \"sequel\" was better, but not by much. Not deserving of #1 in my opinion.\n",

            "Review 664: As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): \"It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day.\" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful \"justice\" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised \"in the American fashion\") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'\n",

            "Review 668: The Godfather is a movie about gangsters. But more importantly, it's a film about gangsters that are also real people, with real relatives and family. The Godfather has all the makings of brilliant movie.The casting is classic with Marlon Brando's unforgettable interpretation of Vito Corleone and the level-headed and dark character of Michael, played by Al Pacino also in the film's two sequels. Aside from great characters the story, pacing and structure of the film has been designed in a way, that even after 2 hours of watching the same movie you still don't feel exhausted like you would with the 2+ hour epics of Peter Jackson.The movie is also incorrectly said to be dark and gory. Certainly the darkness is warranted, but the gore is set in the film rather sparingly and I would reckon the gore in the two later films much more disturbing, even if it's not as extensive. The violence is here to remind of us of the gritty reality of the film's world and it works in a same way as the great family-celebrations bring out the happier and lighter side of the life of a gangster.On all levels The Godfather is a brilliant picture. It's brilliantly acted, cast, directed and written. It is a movie with an old-timesy feel that feels fresh each time you watch it.\n",

            "Review 669: The Godfather (1972) is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola and based on the novel by Mario Puzo, the film tells the epic saga of the Corleone family, a powerful crime dynasty in post-war America. The film explores the themes of power, loyalty, violence, and morality, as the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), tries to protect his interests and pass on his legacy to his reluctant son, Michael (Al Pacino).The film is a masterpiece of storytelling, cinematography, acting, and music. The screenplay, co-written by Puzo and Coppola, is rich with memorable dialogue, complex characters, and gripping plot twists. The film spans a decade, from 1945 to 1955, and covers a wide range of events, from weddings and funerals, to wars and betrayals, to negotiations and assassinations. The film never loses its focus or momentum, as it skillfully balances the personal and the political, the intimate and the epic, the tragic and the comic.The cinematography, by Gordon Willis, is stunning and innovative. The film uses a dark and muted color palette, creating a contrast between the lavish and glamorous lifestyle of the mobsters and the bleak and violent reality of their business. The film also employs a deep focus technique, which allows the foreground and background to be equally sharp and clear, creating a sense of depth and realism. The film also makes effective use of lighting, shadows, and symbolism, such as the use of oranges to foreshadow death, or the use of windows and doors to signify transitions and boundaries.The acting, by a stellar cast of mostly unknown actors at the time, is superb and authentic. Marlon Brando delivers a legendary performance as Don Vito Corleone, the aging and respected leader of the family. Brando transforms himself physically and vocally, using makeup, cotton balls, and a raspy voice, to create a distinctive and iconic character. Brando portrays Don Vito as a complex and contradictory figure, who is ruthless and cunning, but also compassionate and honorable. He is a man who values family above all, but also has to make difficult and sometimes cruel decisions for the sake of his empire.Al Pacino, in his breakthrough role, is equally impressive as Michael Corleone, the youngest and brightest son of Don Vito. Pacino portrays Michael as a reluctant and conflicted heir, who initially wants to distance himself from his family and pursue a legitimate career, but gradually becomes more involved and corrupted by the criminal world. Pacino shows Michael's transformation from a naive and idealistic war hero, to a cold and calculating mob boss, who sacrifices his love, his innocence, and his soul, for the sake of his family and his power.The film also features excellent performances by James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot-headed and impulsive eldest son of Don Vito; Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, the loyal and rational consigliere of the family; Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, the innocent and naive girlfriend and later wife of Michael; Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, the spoiled and abused daughter of Don Vito; John Cazale as Fredo Corleone, the weak and insecure middle son of Don Vito; and many others.The music, by Nino Rota, is haunting and memorable. The film's main theme, composed of a simple and melancholic melody played by a mandolin, is instantly recognizable and evokes the emotions and atmosphere of the film. The film also uses various pop tunes of the period, such as \"Speak Softly Love\" and \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\", to contrast the romance and nostalgia of the characters with the violence and brutality of their actions.The film is a masterpiece of crime and family, that transcends its genre and becomes a universal and timeless story of human nature, ambition, and destiny. The film is not only a thrilling and entertaining spectacle, but also a profound and insightful exploration of the moral dilemmas and psychological consequences of living in a world of corruption and violence. The film is a masterpiece that deserves a score of 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 670: Spoiler WARNINGTelevision takes a pretty bad rap.  It is often derided for its stultifying properties, engendering of abject values and overall ability to vitiate the masses.  Many even claim that it foments a sundering influence over families.  I suppose there is some merit to such an assertion, but I can tell you that when I was growing up the TV was the node in which our otherwise fragmented family coalesced.  I guess we would be referred to as `dysfunctional' today; my father didn't talk to us much and the dinner table was a surface in which to set the groceries until they were put away.  If my parents did ask about how school went, a laconic `alright' would satisfy. But when we sat in front of that glowing cynosure, with its exogenous felicity and fruition, our reticence faded into commentary.  Somehow the factitious world contained in that electronic box inspired us to notice each other.  We watched and we talked.\n",
            "So when it was deemed that I was mature enough to watch the network premier of `The Godfather' I was not only anticipating a good movie, I was looking forward to family bonding. I positively loved to listen to my father and older brothers (I'm the baby) engage in dialogue and repartee in response to the TV.  Their insight brought more to light than my young mind could comprehend with just the presentation as is, and I felt edified as well as inclusive.  Hey some folks have the visits to Yellowstone, I have this.\n",
            "Even though it was too much for an adolescent to fully appreciate, I knew then that this movie was something special.  And as I grew older I watched it every time it aired.  Of course after videos arrived this was the first movie I purchased.  It is the crème de le crème of films, of which I have watched at least 50 times.  It is a work of art that I can call a masterpiece without a bit of hyperbole.  It is my opinion the greatest picture ever made.\n",
            "Though a substantial portion of the film takes place in Sicily, and many customs of that land (as well as cabala) are featured this is a very American story.  It is no less than a stunning examination of the dichotomy that is success in the land of opportunity.  It is a tale of the fine line between legitimacy and profligacy in the capitalist world, of the gray area that exists between transgression and ignominy.  And if the film is a treatise on the American way then the opening line, `I believe in America', is its exordium.  With those prefatory words Coppola sets the tone.\n",
            "What follows is a congeries of dexterous camera shots, first-rate dialogue, incredible acting, untiring character development and one hell of a story. The juxtaposition of criminality and family honor/personal loyalty is achieved with utmost precision.  The motif of personal rectitude vis-à-vis societal ethos pervades the film.  The main characters embody this paradox. They are vicious yet decorous, violent yet urbane, heartless yet not without code.\n",
            "The actors are at their best.  Brando providing gravitas, Cann relishing his bellicose role, Keaton appearing to live her enduring conflict.  It is Pacino of course who must steer the course, as his permutation is unveiled before us.  Pacino achieves this vicissitude with a subtlety that resembles an insidious whisper, inaudible to those who underestimate him.\n",
            "If you will allow me an indulgence I would like to comment on the outstanding ending to this work.   At times movies are often beloved for memorable scenes.  The finale of this tale is as piquant as they come. Coppola understands the power of the doorway, and the shot of Kay's face, overcome with the realization of her husband's duplicity, as the door closes, symbolically shutting her out of his life, is sheer pathos.  Did I mention that I love this ending?  In fact the par excellence of this conclusion has soured me on the sequels.  I have watched them and think they are great, but I do not possess them and never will.  Any extension of this saga is a reproach to this superb terminus ad quem.\n",

Because that one is a GOOD film - with meaning, creativity, fun, likability, and enjoyment. Unlike this, it makes you WANT to do fun things like it features, when watching it. Watching \"the Godfather\", I feel, \"No, I don't want to do or watch these things\".Most of this film is rather just boring & confusing! Everything is shot in the dark (or with a dark filter); you have to make sure you've got something else to do while viewing this *masterpiece.* It's way too long. And it's certainly NOT \"flawless\" - I've spotted a WHOLE bunch of flaws with this flick, that they'd have to be put into many notes! Remember, no film is without flaws. A summary of the flaws with this film are confusing story lines, corrupt characters, crime, violence, some filthy language, bad attitudes, even the false cult of Catholicism being featured, rudeness, mind-aching distressing corrupt plot inconsistencies, or scenes that just don't make sense or just annoy the bazzerk out of you!I couldn't care less if almost all critics everywhere have given it glowing reviews, I don't care if it's generally considered a \"masterpiece\", and I don't care if it has a 9.2 out of 10 on IMDb. I can't believe I fell for such a deceiving look. I'm sad that they've refused to see how horrible it is. The fact is, films have quite the tendency to be either underrated or overrated these days. Seriously, this should be turned around! All the attention towards the \"Godfather\" series should be given instead towards \"Groundhog Day\"; all the awards given to the \"Godfather\" series should be instead towards \"Groundhog Day\". It's THAT good! Please check it out!And plus, Marlon Brando's brought into this flick, and given one of the stupidest accents in film history; sounding so nauseated and drunk, with his chin thrust out so far, it makes me think he's turning into Jim Carrey. This film's also one of the biggest reasons why I don't care about Al Pacino as an actor; how he almost always seems to have a fetish for hardcore violence, swearing, and playing all-round unromantic, unpopular, and unlikable characters.Undoubtedly it was this flick that started a whole film career of mistakes for Al Pacino - I guess he's kind of cool, just not as much as people make him to be.Though to be fair, I do give credit to this film for not including one f-bomb at all.But overall, I think this is certainly one of the worser movies I have seen, and I'm GLAD I didn't watch it growing up.2/10PS: I'm a movie buff who tries to like every film I see.\n",

There seems to be a fundamental gap between those who understand and appreciate the history and the evolution of cinema and those whose powers of perception and attention spans have been impaired by mind-numbing video games and by a culture of total immersion in the utter banality of \"social media.\" I even read one negative review which seriously attempted to draw a comparison between \"The Godfather\" and the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. I loved both movies by the way, but FOR CHRISSAKES! It's apples and oranges! One of those movies was a thoughtful, introspective ADULT film, which are few and far between. The other film, though great entertainment, was not.The acting (across the board), the script (almost entirely Coppola's) and directing (entirely Coppola's) in the \"The Godfather,\" though arguably equaled on occasion, have never been bested by any Hollywood or independent film. One qualification here: to the amazement of every film critic and everyone else alive in the 20th Century, the movie \"The Godfather\" was actually eclipsed by \"The Godfather, Part II,\" which really needs to be seen back-to-back with \"The Godfather\" in order to fully appreciate either film. The two films in combination are really just the 1st and 2nd halves of Mario Puzo's pulp fiction book, entitled \"The Godfather.\" Coppola's screenplay elevated Puzo's 2nd-rate prose immeasurably, and together those two films constitute the single greatest piece of epic-scale movie-making in the history of American cinema.\n",

This is a movie with the most ultimate character development. Each scene makes the next one better. The restaurant scene was one of the most tense scenes in cinema history.

As great as the \"Godfather\" series was, the first \"Godfather\" could have stood on its own without making sequels. By the end of the first part, two family members have died, and one makes a significant climb in power inside the Corleone family; for the answers, you must watch the film. This was a great film and I first saw it in my college film class and since I loved it the first time around I re-rented it. I also plan to rent the following two parts at a later date so I could soak this first part in. Nine hours of \"The Godfather\" is a lot to take in at one time so enjoy this wonderful epic, but over time.\n",

            "Review 680: I have actually already posted a review of The Godfather but my ID was erased for some reason (emfern13). So on with the review. The Godfather is the best Mafia film ever made and also the best film ever made period. The acting is fantastic. Marlon Brando is brillianty as Vito Corleone aka The Godfather. Al Pacino is great as Michael but why is he a Supporting Role? James Caan is excellent, a standout performance as the hot tempered Santino.The acting is also helped by a fantastic script and masterful direction. 10 out of 10.\n",

What I loved about it was the story telling, not exaggerating the crimes, taking the tones seriously and the artful cinematography. Marlon Brando again defined acting and the range of acting. Al Pacino became a star through this film for his extravagant and powerful performance. The production was so neat, the timing of the dialogue. It lives up to the expectation of Mario Puzo's novel. Some of the scenes were so real and eye-opening. It really explores thorough the darkness of human behavior. This is a \"MUST SEE\" movie don't miss it.\n",

When the Don is critically wounded in a mob hit, Vito's only son who hasn't gotten into the business begins to take over.A very in-depth, masterfully told saga of the mafia with an all-star cast: Marlon Brando as The wise Vito, Al Pacino the innocent son who loses his innocence inside business, James Caan the hot headed brother of Pacino who wants his sister to be safe, Robert Duvall the half brother atourney who looks out from all the financial angles. These and many other fine actors create the perfect cast for such a fantastic movie.The film excels in everything. Violence as well, so viewers be warned.Strongly recommended ****/****\n",

            "Review 683: \"The Godfather\" has become a classic in the 28 years since its release. It's definitely a great movie, that hasn't lost any of it's brilliance.  The problems of Don Vito's life are still strong today, especially the issue of drugs.  Marlon Brando gives an Oscar-winning performance as the patriarch of a Mafia family, Don Vito Corleone.  There are also incredible performances by Al Pacino and James Caan, who play Corleone's two sons, Michael and Sonny. Diane Keaton also gave a magnificent performance as Kay.Winner of three Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Actor Marlon Brando (although he refused to accept it because of the discrimination against Indians), \"The Godfather\" has become a staple in my house.  I think it's a movie that everyone should see, and I think many people will agree. Therefore, I give this flawless work a 10.\n",

            "Review 684: The Godfather is a textbook on cinematic lucidity - an exquisite, cohesive Mafia epic that is rightly hailed as an all-time high watermark of American cinema. Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, The Godfather constructs a sprawling family saga that tells the story of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the spider at the center of a web of deceit, murder and larceny. When the Don is left incapacitated by an attempted assassination from a rival crime family, the family quickly seeks to fill the power vacuum left by his absence and it is left up to his sons - the hot tempered Sonny (James Caan), meek mild Fredo (John Cazale), adopted Irish son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), and the fiercely independent Michael (Al Pacino) - to run the Corleone clan. Hardened by the reprisals taken against his family, the 'white-sheep' son Michael Corleone is drawn irresistibly into the gang warfare, which hints at the beginning of his moral descent. Thus underlines the tragedy of The Godfather, with the sins of the father bestowed upon his children, who if not met by death's hand will be plunged into hellfire for their actions. But, underneath all the slayings and sinister \"offers you can't refuse\" this is an immigrant family drama about assimilation, blood loyalty and honor.The Godfather has a richly operatic feel to it, thanks to the solemn and stately classicism that Francis Ford Coppola brings to his pulpy material. He doesn't waste a single frame of celluloid in telling the story of the Corleone family. Every scene illuminates the motivations behind each character and dilemma within the family and all the people that surround it. The artistry of Coppola combined with Gordon Willis' spot-on cinematography and Nino Rota's haunting score covers many scenes in a deep veil of shadow, ensconcing the audience in an atmosphere of unconditional involvement.Each performance is a vignette that fits exquisitely into the whole picture. The character of Vito exhibits the brilliance and innovation of Brando's thespian prowess, creating a staggering mafia figure within a world of stereotype. Brando's restrained motions and rasping speech patterns are stunningly suggestive of power while his actions (courtesy of the script) wield it. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker. As Vito's hesitant son, Pacino rises to the occasion admirably. He beautifully underplays Michael's evolution from returning war hero to the new head of the Corleone family. Caan, gives a splendid portrayal as the hot-headed Sonny while Robert Duvall is steadily efficient as Tom Hagen. Diane Keaton is just right as Michael's oblivious love Kay.The Godfather will continue to hold a central place in cinema history, an epic which has colored everything made subsequently with its imagery and operatic scope. An enduring masterpiece!\n",

            "Review 685: This film is long and dull. As a result of the first it is dull for very long periods, which is why this film warrants no more than a miserly 1/10. The acting is competent but no more and I must confess I lost my focus towards the end due to the quite shocking lack of entertainment that can be attributed to a poor script, lacklustre direction and a plot which leaves a lot to be desired. People say Godfather is rare in that its sequel improves upon it, but that isn't hard. Al Pacino gained a big reputation from this one and I am left bemused as to why, and this unfortunate idea has meant Pacino, a mediocre actor at best has been able to infiltrate our cinema screens on far too many occasions with a distinct lack of passion or charisma in any role he displays.\n",

It might be a shame to admit but i hadn't seen this movie until 2015.After nearly 42 years of its release i finally got a chance to watch it.After watching the movie i found its story to familiar.It is because i have watched countless movies which are directly or indirectly inspired by this film and i must say that this movie was far better than those rip- offs. The movie has a great story.It shows the transition of a reluctant family-man to a crime family boss.The screenplay is absorbing.The cast is wonderful and everybody is peerless in their respective roles.In short this film is superb and wonderful.But i can't consider it as a great film.I don't know why it is called so?May be it had been a very original story during 70's but now it is not so.I am not a film scholar,neither i am a movie buff nor a cinema aficionado but i have seen many classics of World cinema and i found some movies which are far better than this one. I am not saying that this is not a great film.It is great,after all so many people like this and so many can't be wrong.This is a respectable movie after all this movie has influenced countless films.This movie might be great but not the greatest ever. This is an excellent example of mobster film.Positive points of this film are its evergreen story,its soulful musical score,its engaging screenplay,nice direction,great dialogs and amazing acting.The only negative point of the movie is its slow pace and overlong runtime.So at last i want to say that it is an awesome piece of art and everybody must watch it.May be due to time difference or due to cultural gap,i was unable to grasp it completely. 7.9 out of 10 is my final rating.\n",

            "Review 689: \"The Godfather\" is flawless, and one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. This is the best role Al Pacino ever played, and he didn't win best actor. The only negative thing i could say i have against the film. Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940's, in this well- respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving \"business\" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.\n",

            "Review 692: The Godfather is easily the shining star in the crime genre and 'epic' films in general. It is seen as one of the greatest films of all time and it's pretty simple to see why. Everything about it is magnificent, the story is one of cinemas finest, the characters are dynamic and well developed, the music is timeless and it captures post-war America/organised crime era like no other. The story follows the Corleone crime family, the aging head Don Vito wishes to move his family into modern times which corresponds with his youngest son Michael returning from the war and his daughter's wedding. The Don is approached to do a deal with drug dealer Sollozzo, but turns him down which leads to his own fatal shooting. This leads to the aggressive Sonny talking control and Michael, who was set to lead a normal life, being dragged into a mob war that changes the family like no-one could have imagined. The story is brilliant, it's never straightforward and will always keep you guessing as what will happen to the characters. It takes you on a journey, starting at one place and ending a million miles away, but making sure that everything flows and makes sense.Every single cast member nails their role, which is some achievement given the massive amount of characters. Marlon Brando gives one of cinemas greatest characters as the aging Don, everything from the way he speaks to the way he moves is perfectly done. Al Pacino got his breakthrough and he commands the screen. The way he manages to show the subtle changes in the seemingly calm Michael are excellent, he becomes more twisted and less humane as the film goes on. After all it is mainly based on the changes he goes through. James Caan is also brilliant as the hot-headed Sonny, his great screen presence works wonders in showing a man who can't control is anger. Robert Duvall deserves equal praise as the reserved and smart Tom Hagen, a nice alternative to the others. Everyone else is great, from Richard Castellano and Abe Vigoda as Vito right hand men to John Cazale as the frail Fredo to Al Lettieri as the menacing Sollozzo to Diane Keaton as the gentle Kay. The look of the film is fantastic, the cinematography is dark and dimly coloured which helps to reflect the era perfectly. The music is equally fabulous. The main theme is one of the most recognisable of all time and the music does carry an authentic Italian feel. The depth in which Coppola goes to study these characters has to applauded too, giving some of the most well developed characters on the big screen. The way they are different and sometimes polar opposites , the way Sonny lacks control and is aggressive whilst Michael is very much in control and distant. This fascinating aspect helps develop events greatly. The violence makes more sense here, it's done to shape the characters views and set off new events instead of just being there for the sake of it. That idea is what also elevates the film, everything is done for a reason and fits in perfectly with the story giving most of the events much more weight and meaning than usual. The film also excellently sets up events, such as Michael warning Fredo not to side against the family and the move to Nevada, that would be explored in part II. There's not one bad thing about the whole film, one of the few films where that can be said. The Godfather remains incredibly gripping and intriguing all the way through thanks to the epic story, acting and directing.\n",

            "Review 693: with the passing of Marlon Brando I decided to once again view this film that garnered so much interest in the early 70s and beyond. I cant believe how young the lead players were! Brando looked older then however, necessary for proper plot development and atmosphere. I finally understood the manouvering that happens related to the criminal wars that take place twice during the film, once when don corleone has an attempt on his life and then again as michael asserts his influence.I read the book which was better than the movie but only marginally. Im not sure I would vote it best of all those on file with IMDb but I cant think of an alternative. being 'best' is such an arbitrary thing anyway; best in what category? best overall? what criteria? what year? it truly is a remarkable movie though, classic performances and a very tight storyline with some memorable lines and scenes. its no wonder that Al Pacino's career never looked back after this performance.it may or may not be the best movie ever made but it should certainly be required viewing by anyone contemplating a career in the mob. or in law enforcement or film-making or Italian cuisine for that matter.one thing I am sure of, if ever humans reach the stars (pun intended) this will be one piece of entertainment that goes with them.9.999 / 10\n",

            "Review 694: The Godfather is often considered to be one of the greatest films of all time and for good reason. It's a timeless classic that doesn't feel like it dated a day, only getting better with each passing watch. It is Coopla's magnum opus, showing the potential that cinema has as a storytelling art form. It revolutionised narrative as rather than telling the story of one character, Coopla built up a life style by showing these criminals in both their everyday life and when under threat. The story spans 5 years, showing us every detail of how the mafia operates. We see everything from their joy at a wedding to their shaded business meetings where death is talked about callously without guilt.When violence is used Coppola never holds back. He will show every gruesome detail with faces gasping for oxygen, the blood trickling down their skin and the intense screams of pain of the victims. It is this realism and details that make many of the most memorable scenes as it was one of the first times that a film used such realistic violence. The film probably has one of the greatest casts assembled to a film with so many memorable characters. Even with a 3 hour runtime, many of these characters don't even play that large a role in the story or even get too much screen time. But the actors get their roles down so incredibly that they build their own character through the way they speak or the hesitance of talking against a powerful figure like the godfather. Throughout the film doesn't have a single weak performance. But of course the stand out of the cast was Brando. I remains one of cinemas most memorable performances, with his introducing shot alone being one of the most recognisable images in cinema with his calm reaction to being asked to kill a man. He becomes the image of power inciting fear into even his own assassins who stutter when talking to him. Certainly Brando is the film's most iconic role, though sometimes overlooked is Pacino with one of the most memorable transformations in film going from a respected war veteran to violent crime lord. Far more emotional than his father he is hesitant about violence at first, but quickly becomes accustomed to the violence of his life of crime. By the end of the film he doesn't second think killing his own step brother as an act of vengeance. Pacino was perfect at emphasising this change with both the tone of his voice and rage in his eyes creating the real image of a man who has changed over the years. But it's not quality alone that has made this film so memorable. What makes The Godfather such an icon of cinema because it represents what all films should try to accomplish, by taking risks that no other film would make. Coppola was never afraid to show the detailed violence or take risks by experimenting with narrative, because he wanted to make his own unique vision on screen. It's for this reason that it has become timeless, representing a masterclass in filmmaking and reminding us all of the innovation that makes us love cinema.\n",

The opening wedding scene ranks as one of the most effective introductions in film history.

Nino Rota's beautiful score is one of the best, with the \"Love Theme\" ranking as one of the most famous pieces of film music ever.  The performances are all first rate.

The first time I watched \"The Godfather\", I was a child and it was the most astonishing film I'd ever seen. Due to my introversion, I was spending too much leisure time in front of TV, and consequently I watched many films during my childhood. However, I can hardly remember those films. But The Godfather isn't one of them. I remember The Godfather as if I watched it yesterday. The Godfather made me experience feelings of admiration. There is almost no film that has 3 hours running time and didn't bore me. But The Godfather was a breathtaking film for me. I admire Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo for reducing the thick, best-selling book to the controllable screenplay which anticipated the expectations of the millions who had already read the book. For me, the strength of the Mario Puzo-Francis Ford Coppola script is the unbelievable interaction of all these characters. Seeing 'The Godfather' is still one of the biggest milestones of the film industry 46 years after its release confirms the film's status as an outdated masterpiece. Whenever I see it, it becomes better and impeccable.\n",

This is not simply a movie: this is a cultural touchstone, a landmark of human achievement, and a beautiful work of art realized by one of the few true masters of filmmaking, Francis Ford Coppola. THE GODFATHER comes as close to perfection as any film ever could. The directing, acting, writing, cinematography, editing, set design, etc. etc. etc. are all world-class and I've never seen a film do better. Marlon Brando is stunningly brilliant as Vito Corleone, the aging head of a New York crime family; I only wish he had more screen time. Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable and tragic performances ever put to film as Michael Corleone, the reluctant heir to the throne. The supporting cast all give remarkable performances without exception; but Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and John Cazale stand out the most.

            "Review 701: THE GODFATHER is an example of how stories change over the years. In Washington Irving's LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW, we had the headless horseman. In Mario Puzo's GODFATHER, we had the headless horse.In all seriousness, there is only one other movie I have given a perfect 10 to so far, and that's TORA TORA TORA. It took me a while to appreciate this movie. The first time I saw GODFATHER, I saw more blood and gore than I remember ever seeing in any movie before, though it's pretty tame by today's standards. My mind wandered quite a bit during it and I came out of there kind of glad it was over. Then, several months later, I heard the soundtrack and I liked it so much, I thought I would give this movie another chance. It has come to be my all time favorite movie. And the music is still great. The mellow, folklike soundtrack provides a nice balance to the violence that goes on throughout the movie.Francis Ford Coppola is faithful to the book and tells the story very well. Watching the way certain scenes are set up is like watching the workings of a fine Swiss watch, it is that good. It gives depth and insight into the workings of the Mafia that no other movie before or since ever has. The point of view this story is told in is controversial, ie, they give you possible justifications for some of the things they do, and it almost makes you sympathize with the characters. The most telling lines in the story is when Michael comes back after hiding out in Sicily for the murder of a police officer and a bigshot in a rival family. He is talking to Kay, telling her he has decided to go into business with his father, and tells her that his father is no different than anyone else who is responsible for people's welfare, like a Congressman or President. Kay states that is naive because Congressmen and Presidents don't have people killed. Michael then fixes her with that patented stare (Al Pacino was perfect in this role) and says, \"Who's being naive, Kay?\" That is a very chilling moment, as is Michael's transformation from wholesome American war hero to the head of one of the most powerful Mafia families in the country. Another telling moment is when Michael meets with his father in the garden and they are discussing business strategies, and the Don says, \"I don't apologize for my life. I did what I had to to protect my family, and I refused to be a fool for those pezzanovante who were holding the strings.\" In conclusion, you will have a tough time convincing me that there is a Mafia movie anywhere that is better than THE GODFATHER. 10 out of 10.\n",

            "Review 705: My father made me watch this with him when I was 17. At first I was put off by the seemingly slow pace. But gradually the vast canvas and the gorgeous visuals began to draw me in. I had never expected that an 'old' film would be so beautiful to look at. At the end my father asked me what I thought of it. I replied that it was 'bigger' than anything I had ever seen before, but I also felt that it lacked depth. Thats when my father hit me with it : he pointed out for my benefit that \"you're not allowed to have an opinion on this film.\" At 17, I used to think that having an opinion about something was a democratic and reasonable thing.With this film, Coppola managed to articulate notions & myths about the Italian Mafia, notions that had existed for decades but had never been so artistically depicted before, at least not in films. No mainstream picture before had ever depicted the mafia in anything deeper than black-&-white stereotypes of good and evil. The production design, photography, the performances and Nino Rota's score are so perfectly welded together that you never doubt for a moment that the world within the film EXISTS.I'm sure intellectuals have a field day with this film. A psychologist would detect seething undercurrents of homoeroticism, combined with a feudal & patriarchal mindset. A film analyst would probably criticise the straightforward storytelling style, as opposed to a twisting & warped narrative format of the noir convention, where the viewer changes what is viewed. A philosopher would berate the film for having no depth or inherent meaning, and its characters for lacking any real consciousness of themselves or the world. The film has one singular idea : the rationalizing of murder by calling it \"business, not personal\", which is appalling.I still think this is the best monument of popular culture, over time as well as place. It is the ultimate elevation of style over substance, but undeniably the film is tastefully made. There are moments in this film that nobody forgets : the opening marriage scene, the decapitated horse, the meeting of the five families, and of course every single scene that Marlon Brando is in. To my mind, the Godfather is probably the best compromise we've yet seen between art and commerce.\n",

Marlon Brando plays the character of Don Vito Corleone with complete emotion, meaning and accuracy. Al pacino's character of Michael Corleone and son of the Don. These two main characters grip the audience throughout the epic tale of gangland New York and the changes through the mid 20th Century. Through Don Vitos decline as the Godfather the reluctant Michael is dragged further in. Pacino performs his greatest part through this.

The all time classic aimed at family life. That makes the mafia movie full of humanity. Although they are mafia, they are still human beings. They also cherish family though the way for protecting family is violent. That is the most attractive place for the movie.As to the director Francis Ford Coppola, he did a great job(in fact Paramont prepared to replace him anytime. Lukily they did not do so). He is an Italian. Maybe Italian emphasizes the importance of family. When he directed the movie, he successfully made the cast like a family. No wonder he still could gather the same cast to shoot Godfather the third after 16 years.As to performance, Al Pacino is unforgettable though he was a rookie. Marlon Brando deserved the Oscar award (best actor). Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton also were great. As to the music, still great.A mafia classic you absolutely should not miss. 9/10\n",

The film was as brilliant as I had expected, and more.\"The Godfather\" thrills right to the core of the world of Italian-American (gangster) families after the second World War. In the year 1946 the Corleone family has a powerful position in the under world. The family's head don Vito Corleone (just amazing Marlon Brando) has connections and relations in politics, police forces etc. But he also has enemies. There is also four other families wanting to have as much power as they can get. The first big trouble emerges when don Vito refuses to take part in narcotic-business. There is conspiracy and vengeance bubbling underneath.One of the most fascinating themes in the movie is Corleone's youngest son's (Al Pacino) struggle of being part of the gangster family. Don Vito does not want Michael to involve family business but the blood is thicker than wine. Michael says he is not going to become like his father but in time he will realize that his destiny is to become the Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's magnificent directing and amazing script of the author Mario Puzo makes \"The Godfather\" very enjoyable and thrilling to watch. Also the talented cast (Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall etc.)is like a cherry on the top of delicious ice-cream portion.The film is really capturing.

            "Review 713: Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" truly qualifies as the \"Gone with the Wind\" of gangster movies. The first installment in the Oscar-winning trilogy covers decades, mob wars, romances, intrigue, and treachery. Specifically, \"The Godfather\" received three Oscars. First, it was voted Best Picture; the Academy recognized Marlon Brando as Best Actor, and Coppola shares a Best Writing statuttee with Mario Puzo. Clocking in at a robust 175 minutes, \"The Godfather\" cast Brando as the seasoned Don Vito Corleone, with Al Pacino elbowing his way right behind him as the youngest son Michael. James Caan makes a lot of fuss as Pacino's older brother Sonny, and the ever dependable Robert Duval is cast as the consigliere for the family. Interestingly, Caan, Duval, and Pacino all competed for Best Supporting Actor, and Coppola was up for Best Director. Dean Tavoularis' production designs, Warren Clymer's art direction, and Philip Smith's set decoration are all sumptuous. The best scenes include Michael's massacre at the restaurant, Carlo and his wife smashing dishes, Sonny's ambush in the causeway, Brando's death scene in the tomato patch, and the finale with the elimination of all of Michael's enemies. The screenplay deserved an Oscar. The least shall be first as Michael demonstrates during his meteoric rise to power. The dialogue contains quotable lines and several interesting characters who aren't relatives of the Corleone clan. Gordon Willis' shadowy, straight-on photography captures the treachery of the crime syndicate. Of course, \"The Godfather, Part II\" surpasses it in every respect, and it deserved the six Oscars that it garnered.\n",

            "Review 715: The majority of critics will cite the definitive \"greatest film of all-time\" as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called \"gangster flicks\", most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses \"gangsterism\" as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to \"join the family\" because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.Arguably, the theme of \"violence breeding violence\" is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the \"matter-of-fact\" nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the \"false\" commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages.\n",

            "Review 716: Given the rave reviews, I was very excited when I finally had time to sit down and watch this movie start to finish. I ended up more than a little disappointed. My biggest complaint is that the movie glorifies the underworld in a way that ends up seeming very corny--one scene features a bunch of civilized looking crime lords sitting around a table talking about how gambling, alcohol, and prostitution are OK, but drugs cross the line.Sure, the story incorporates a lot of dramatic effects, but in the end I felt like the drama was forced into the setting in a cheap attempt to make mid-20th century organized crime look serious and exciting. In this way, The Godfather is a little bit like rap music--it validates a fast-paced, unlawful lifestyle by glorifying the coming of power and masculinity that its main characters undergo.\n",

            "Review 723: The gangster is the unacceptable face of the American myth. He is the antithesis of the western hero; he is not society's saviour but its public enemy. The 1930's gangster film was rooted in headlines of the day; it was a resolutely contemporary genre. The first gangster cycle responded to the restrictions of Prohibition and the effects of the Depression. These gangsters defied harsh economic realities and in doing so became anti-heroes of the people. Their defiance of authority made them relevant and popular; they were the dark side of the American dream.In the first cycle of gangster films, the criminals were positioned as alien to the WASP norm. These Italian and Irish gangsters were separated by their ethnicity. The Hays Code soon came in to try and combat these films. It forbade the vilification of ethnic groups and banned films focusing on criminal behaviour. This shifted emphasis to law enforcers. It was hard therefore to truly make gangster films. The genre was pushed to the margins and remained out with the mainstream for a long time. In the late 60's Bonnie and Clyde changed all this. Its mix of violence, New Hollywood style, anti-authoritarian stance and counter-culture relevance brought the gangster film right up to date. The scene was set for The Godfather.Francis Ford Coppola's film was the first epic gangster film. It made it a durable genre. But it was significantly different to the 30's gangster movies like The Public Enemy. It was not a rise and fall narrative. Don Vito Corleone begins the film at the height of his powers and dies peacefully while playing with his grandson; he does not die in the gutter. Neither does he exhibit the brash over-reaching arrogance that typified the 30's gangsters. He treats his position within the community as a responsibility and he has moral limits. The film does not end with the fall of the crime family; it climaxes with Michael Corleone at the absolute peak of his powers. The changes to censorship now allowed for a narrative to focus on criminals, in the case of The Godfather it went as far as virtually eliminating every other point-of-view; in this film people out with the crime family are the aliens. Where the 30's gangsters were at odds with society, the gangster here is the power structure. The Corleones are the good bad guys. When this film was made Vietnam had destroyed the certainties Americans had about their country. The Godfather seemed to say if American society is rotten, organised crime is only part of the problem, sometimes the solution.The film stressed the universal theme of loyalty to the family. This helped cloak its critique of American society in a conservative framework. It not only put the gangster back in the centre of film narrative but it also stressed ethnicity in a positive way. They were no longer apart but important members of the establishment. The law enforcers depicted here are more corrupt. They act in a criminal way but without any moral code. In many ways it is a transgressive film.Acting is great across the board. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall stand out particularly in a true heavyweight cast. The story unfolds beautifully with a fantastic script to propel it. Coppola holds the whole thing together with some brilliance. He doesn't really do anything fancy but just lets all the superlative components at his disposal do their thing and ensures they all connect together into a film of huge class. The Godfather is a masterwork and remains a primary reason why the era of the New Hollywood will always be cherished.\n",

It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light.

        "The assignment presented a comprehensive task involving various natural language processing (NLP) techniques, which I found both challenging and enjoyable. Implementing functionalities like POS tagging, constituency parsing, dependency parsing, and named entity recognition required a good understanding of NLP concepts and tools like NLTK and Stanford CoreNLP. Managing the flow of data from web scraping to text cleaning and then to syntactic analysis demanded careful planning and attention to detail. The diversity of tasks within the assignment made it intellectually stimulating, and I appreciated the opportunity to apply and deepen my knowledge of NLP. However, ensuring the accuracy and efficiency of each step, especially in handling large volumes of text data, added complexity to the assignment. Overall, I found the time allotted for the assignment adequate, although certain aspects, like debugging and refining the code, could have benefited from more time.\n",
